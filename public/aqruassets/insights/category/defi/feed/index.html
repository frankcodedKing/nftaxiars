										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>DeFi is short for “Decentralised Finance”: an alternative financial system</strong> made possible by Blockchain technology that doesn’t rely on the traditional banking ecosystem driven by debt-powered “Fiat currency”.</p>
<p>The idea is that a financial ecosystem can function reliably without needing concepts such as “trust” and “permissions”. By using theoretically incorruptible technology to store data worldwide, and by giving payments to people for doing processing, systems such as <a href="https://aqru.io/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://aqru.io/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> prosper.</p>
<p>Activities that can take place in this new world are traditional activities such as lending, depositing and borrowing, as well as new activities such as “<a href="https://aqru.io/insights/what-is-staking-crypto/">staking</a>”.</p>
<p>Of course, being a new technology, it brings new concepts and terms with it, so here’s a guide to some of the most common terms. We’ve tried to introduce them in a sensible order!</p>
<h2>1. Blockchain</h2>
<p>A Blockchain is a shared database that holds details of transactions. It also contains an almost infinite number of “addresses” (like mini-wallets) that can hold a digital record of whatever asset is being used. First introduced in Bitcoin, this concept underlies all Cryptocurrency – its genius is that it allows a financial system to be run by a crowd of normal computers and people without being controlled by any of them. <strong>All Blockchains have an associated native Cryptocurrency</strong>: BTC for Bitcoin, ETH for Ethereum, XRP for Ripple, etc.</p>
<h2>2. Tokens</h2>
<p>A token is a digital entity that exists on a host Blockchain, which can be transferred between addresses as required. Unlike real-world currency, it can also contain data. Governments regard tokens and Cryptocurrency as “property”, and therefore trading them for other tokens can be a taxable activity. It’s complicated!</p>
<p>Some tokens are used to represent shares in something in the real world, or simply promise buyers that the price will increase. This may make them “securities”, and securities that are unregistered with the relevant financial agencies such as the SEC are unlawful. This is a giant problem in the current token ecosystem.</p>
<h2>3. Tokenomics</h2>
<p>Each token might behave in a slightly different way, and it can be important to know how it’s designed: how tokens are created, how are they destroyed, how people are rewarded for transaction processing, and whether there are any benefits to HODLing or staking tokens, etc.</p>
<h2>4. HODL</h2>
<p>There’s a debate over whether this originated as a typo or as an acronym: “Hold on for Dear Life”. As you might gather, HODL means to hold onto coins long-term whatever life may throw at you (or them).</p>
<h2>5. Stablecoins</h2>
<p>Stablecoins are tokens that are designed to mirror and track the value of an underlying asset, usually a real-world one. For instance, there are tokens such as <a href="https://aqru.io/earn-interest-usdc/">USDC</a> that mirror the US Dollar. <strong>These tokens use code to stabilise their own price</strong> and require the coin to be backed by some underlying asset to justify its price – for instance, you might expect an organisation that had issued billions of US Dollar Stablecoins to own the equivalent amount of US Dollars or other assets.</p>
<h2>6. DEX/CEX</h2>
<p>Both of these terms refer to exchanges: organisations where tokens can be swapped for other tokens. <strong>DEX is a Decentralised Exchange</strong> where buyers and sellers attach their wallets and the DEX facilitates trades between anonymous buyers.</p>
<p>A Centralised Exchange (CEX) is a company that runs their own trading platform and gets to dictate what tokens they support (which will be spread over many Blockchains). Recent regulation means that anonymous exchange accounts are now effectively illegal, with exchanges running “KYC” and “AML” – “Know Your Customer” and “Anti-Money Laundering”, which effectively means “proof of identity” such as photo ID and proof of address.</p>
<h2>7. Pump and Dump</h2>
<p>This is when a group of investors collude to defraud investors. They drive the price of a token up by buying enough tokens to make it appear as if genuine positive price action is happening: once enough other investors have jumped on the bandwagon and driven the token price up, the schemers jump ship and the token plummets again. Quite often the pump and dump action is amplified by hype: on social media “Pump and Dump” groups exist.</p>
<p>The bigger the coin, the more difficult it is to manipulate this way, but smaller coins on bigger exchanges suffer from it all the time.</p>
<h2>8. Ethereum</h2>
<p>“<a href="https://aqru.io/ethereum/">Ethereum</a>” is both a Blockchain and a token (shortened to ETH). It was devised as a smarter alternative to <a href="https://aqru.io/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>, can host multiple other tokens, and supports dApps and Smart Contracts.</p>
<h2>9. Gas Fees</h2>
<p>This refers to the need on any Blockchain for payment to be made to make a transaction happen. On the Ethereum Blockchain, Gas itself is a separate token (convertible to and from ETH). While the ideal for Cryptocurrency is for negligible Gas Fees, on Ethereum that’s very far from true: a situation that the new version of Ethereum (ETH 2.0) aims to correct.</p>
<p>Transmission fees are the biggest obstacle to “<a href="https://aqru.io/insights/what-is-yield-farming/">Yield Farming</a>”.</p>
<h2>10. dApp</h2>
<p>A dApp is a smart contract with a user interface.</p>
<h2>11. TVL/TLV</h2>
<p>“Total Value Locked” is the total amount of tokens stored in a given ecosystem (such as a DEX or dAPP).</p>
<h2>12. Smart Contract</h2>
<p><strong>A Smart Contract is a piece of code on a Blockchain that contains a set of rules about transactions</strong>. For instance, you could have a piece of code that, when it received money, would automatically distribute the money that it received to multiple addresses. A series of interacting Smart Contracts would form a financial ecosystem. Improperly written Smart Contracts can be an existential danger to a Blockchain if they allow it to be hacked.</p>
<h2>13. DAO</h2>
<p>“Decentralised Autonomous Organisation”. An organisation whose functions consist entirely of Smart Contracts. In the interests of transparency, the Smart Contracts running the Blockchain would always be visible.</p>
<h2>14. Collateral</h2>
<p>As in the real financial world, most loans of any risk involve putting up collateral: something you own that can be taken away if you fail to repay the loan.</p>
<h2>15. Liquidity Mining/Yield Farming</h2>
<p>This is the strategy where the yield from one investment is invested into another opportunity elsewhere to optimise returns. Note that re-<br />
investment of yields in <a href="https://aqru.io/crypto-interest/account/">interest-bearing accounts</a> is the easiest form of Yield Farming.</p>
<h2>16. Liquidity Pools</h2>
<p><strong>Decentralised exchanges only work because they have a pool of tokens to help in the trading process</strong>. Those pools are called “Liquidity Pools”, and anyone can insert their coins to put them at the service of the DEX. In return, they receive rewards of varying kinds, including shares of fees and DEX tokens. The rewards, like everything else, are different from DEX to DEX and governed by Smart Contracts.</p>
<p>Providing funds to Liquidity Pools is an important part of the DeFi process that allows interest-bearing Crypto accounts such as AQRU.io to exist and to offer returns of up to <a href="https://aqru.io/crypto-interest/">7% on Stablecoins and 1% on Crypto</a>.</p>
<h2>17. NFTs</h2>
<p>The whole point of a currency is that each token is more or less identical to the other ones. The term for this is “fungible”. But what if you create one token that represents one real-world thing? Well, then you have a “Non-Fungible Token”, or NFT. Like other tokens, these can be sold or traded, but <strong>each NFT has different characteristics from all the others</strong>.</p>
<p>At the time of writing the most visible use of NFTs is representing digital media, but their most sustainable and sensible use would be for digitally storing data such as ID.</p>
<p>Many regard the current NFT marketplace as an unregulated marketplace selling dubiously sourced items of unreliable valuation for inflated prices.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you ever get the feeling that you exist to serve bankers, and not the other way round? Watching the world for the last few decades, it’s difficult to avoid the conclusion that the financial interests of most of us are not a priority for the high-powered, politician-heavy, over-entitled traditional financial industry.</p>
<p>DeFi (“Decentralised Finance”) grew out of <a href="https://aqru.io/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> and Blockchain, which themselves were an expression of dissatisfaction with an out-of-control traditional finance sector that almost destroyed itself in 2008 with its own greed – and which then made sure taxpayers were wiped out instead.</p>
<p>In its purest form, <strong>the vision for DeFi was an alternative banking system for the common man</strong>: incorruptible, transparent, and controlled not by greedy bankers or voracious middlemen, but by predictable, transparent sets of rules.</p>
<p>Of course, pure visions never last too long when a system gets actual people in it. However, even in its current imperfect form, DeFi is still a viable (and possibly the only) alternative for wealth building to the tilted playing field of the rich that makes up the stagnating world of traditional finance.</p>
<p>And after all, you’re here to learn how to build your wealth, right? Right.</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p><strong>DeFi has a lot of promise, but it can’t create miracles</strong>: if you haven’t got at least some wealth to invest, then you’re not going to get very far.</p>
<p>For instance, the free 10USDC investment you get when you sign up for an <a href="https://aqru.io/crypto-interest/account/">AQRU Crypto savings account</a> is excellent, but you’ll need more than that to provide wealth for the future!</p>
<h2>DeFi and Traditional Finance</h2>
<p><em>Fun fact: did you know that at 3% interest, with interest paid daily and compounded, it will take five years, nine months and nine days for your investment to double? And at 0.5%, a standard rate found in traditional finance, that would take you 235 years?</em></p>
<p><strong>It’s a much more level playing field in DeFi than in traditional finance</strong>, where everything is tilted against the individual investor and in favour of the institutional investor. Their systems can see your share purchases and get in faster to screw you over. The gap between borrower/credit card interest rates and savings interest rates is just ludicrously large. The banks can turf you out of your house and deny you enough money to live. And, it turns out, they can also exclude you from the financial system entirely on a political whim.</p>
<p>Not so with DeFi. Regulatory issues and uncertainty about Crypto have so far prevented the banks from taking a major role in DeFi, so the gaps have been filled by individuals and small companies.</p>
<p>There’s a downside, of course – not all individuals and small companies have your best interests at heart either. Even if the technology is incorruptible, there’s no shortage of scams at the human end of Crypto – whether it be fake coins launched to make a mint, pump and dump scams that exploit human desperation, or hackers determined to steal it all by exploiting poorly designed code.</p>
<p>What this means is that <strong>to start investing in DeFi, it would be advisable to take a safety-first approach</strong>: in fact, that applies to all investing. Don’t invest more than you could afford to lose, and especially not the money you’ll need in the short-to-medium term.</p>
<h2>What’s the Future of DeFi?</h2>
<p>It depends on which part of DeFi you’re talking about: it’s a wide area, and there are some aspects that make politicians and regulators nervous: DEX in particular.</p>
<p>Technologically, Blockchain is the future and will invade traditional finance which has an infrastructure far more clumsy than it would appear from using it. Political meddling in the financial system might well drive entire countries to participate far more in DeFi.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies and Stablecoins will be joined by more CBDCs (“Central Bank Digital Currency”): China’s launch of its digital Yuan was a game-changer, and the US and UK are also discussing their own.</p>
<p>In general, regulatory pressure has increased on companies in the ecosystem and much closer attention is being paid to the parts of the ecosystem that have the most value: centralised exchanges and off-ramps to fiat currency. Exchanges and tokens that don’t pass regulatory approval will either close entirely or become close to worthless.</p>
<p>Major Cryptocurrencies, being safe from securities law, should continue unaffected, and <strong>approved tokens and Crypto might well increase in value substantially</strong>.</p>
<p>Digital Security tokens will take off as stocks and shares move to the Blockchain, with INX Securities leading the way as an SEC-regulated digital securities exchange. The normal stock exchange works only a few hours in the day and is unable to sell fractions of a share: it also takes days to settle a trade. With the Blockchain, it’s 24/7 transparent trading, fractional share purchase, and instant settlement. You’ve got to wonder how long it will take for stock exchanges worldwide to make that journey!</p>
<h3>Making your Future Safer</h3>
<p>The sure way to avoid regulatory problems later is to invest your funds with a trustworthy, secure and stable company that deals in more established Cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and its derivatives like Bitcoin Cash, <a href="https://aqru.io/ethereum/">Ethereum</a>, and a range of other properly decentralised Crypto, and Stablecoins that are properly backed.</p>
<p>One such company is AQRU, probably the simplest way to get started <a href="https://aqru.io/crypto-interest/">investing in DeFi</a>, and offers at least assurance of customer service and adherence to the rule of law, though as with all investment decisions, your due diligence is required!</p>
<h2>Getting started with AQRU.io</h2>
<h3>1. Download the app or visit the website</h3>
<p>The AQRU app can be found on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1576493853" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a> or on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.accru" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>. You can also <a href="https://app.aqru.io/register">register via the website</a> at AQRU.io – a website is really important for keeping track of your assets when using a mobile isn’t possible, or when you just want a larger screen and more features, and you can use your account on any of them.</p>
<p>Here, we’ll look at the iOS app.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1435 size-quarter-width" src="https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/img_4873-320x692.png" alt="AQRU app" width="320" height="692" srcset="https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/img_4873-320x692.png 320w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/img_4873-139x300.png 139w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/img_4873-473x1024.png 473w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/img_4873-768x1662.png 768w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/img_4873-710x1536.png 710w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/img_4873-947x2048.png 947w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/img_4873-1280x2769.png 1280w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/img_4873-640x1385.png 640w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/img_4873.png 1284w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></p>
<h3>2. Open an account for free</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-quarter-width wp-image-1441" src="https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/img_4874-320x692.png" alt="create an account" width="320" height="692" srcset="https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/img_4874-320x692.png 320w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/img_4874-139x300.png 139w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/img_4874-473x1024.png 473w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/img_4874-768x1662.png 768w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/img_4874-710x1536.png 710w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/img_4874-947x2048.png 947w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/img_4874-1280x2769.png 1280w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/img_4874-640x1385.png 640w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/img_4874.png 1284w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></p>
<p>Make sure you read the <a href="https://cdn.accru.finance/documents/user-agreement.pdf?t=1651760913219" target="_blank" rel="noopener">user agreement</a>: it’s important.</p>
<p>Notice that there’s a referral code: you can get $75 for referring a friend, subject to them joining and depositing a certain amount of Crypto in their account. If a friend referred you, then do them a favour and use the code! You’ve nothing to lose!</p>
<h3>3. Verify your identity</h3>
<p>Are you really you? Now’s your chance to prove it to AQRU!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-quarter-width wp-image-1446" src="https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/image3-320x430.png" alt="verify identity" width="320" height="430" srcset="https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/image3-320x430.png 320w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/image3-224x300.png 224w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/image3-640x859.png 640w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/image3.png 748w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></p>
<p>This step involves uploading a photo ID, proof of address, and also taking a selfie. Make sure you do that Crypto scowl that says “I’m enduring this long enough to make 3% yield but I’m not happy about it, plus my eyebrows look strange”.</p>
<p>The verification process is manual, so patience may be required.</p>
<h3>4. Deposit funds</h3>
<p>You already have 10USDC, but of course, you’ll probably need more. The minimum deposit is 100 Euros, and there’s no deposit fee, other than fees that may apply by buying Crypto through <a href="https://www.moonpay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MoonPay</a>. Click or tap “Deposit” once you’ve verified, and exercise your right to choose from these options: <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-quarter-width wp-image-1443" src="https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/img_4875-320x692.png" alt="Deposit funds" width="320" height="692" srcset="https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/img_4875-320x692.png 320w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/img_4875-139x300.png 139w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/img_4875-473x1024.png 473w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/img_4875-768x1662.png 768w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/img_4875-710x1536.png 710w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/img_4875-947x2048.png 947w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/img_4875-1280x2769.png 1280w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/img_4875-640x1385.png 640w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/img_4875.png 1284w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></p>
<p><em>Bank transfers</em> supported are EUR and GBP (EUR deposits use SEPA, whilst GBP deposits are completed through FPS and may take up to 48 hours to appear in your account).</p>
<p><em>Crypto transfers</em> are sent to a wallet address provided by AQRU (represented by a QR code you can scan into the wallet or exchange you’re sending the Crypto from). The Crypto appears in your account when the transaction has been verified by the Blockchain.</p>
<p>Note that while AQRU doesn’t apply fees to receiving it, you will have to pay Blockchain transmission fees for sending it (and exchanges may charge a withdrawal fee).</p>
<h3>5. Earn!</h3>
<p>You’re not quite invested yet! To do that, you need click on the “Buy” button to move funds into your investment account. Here’s what you see when you do this with USD – note that it’s a basket of Stablecoins rather than just one, which improves stability even further. A super Stablecoin, if you like!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-quarter-width wp-image-1444" src="https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/img_4877-320x692.png" alt="earn interest on stablecoin" width="320" height="692" srcset="https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/img_4877-320x692.png 320w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/img_4877-139x300.png 139w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/img_4877-473x1024.png 473w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/img_4877-768x1662.png 768w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/img_4877-710x1536.png 710w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/img_4877-947x2048.png 947w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/img_4877-1280x2769.png 1280w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/img_4877-640x1385.png 640w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2022/05/img_4877.png 1284w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></p>
<h3>6. Watch your earnings grow</h3>
<p>Interest is displayed per second as you watch but properly added to your account daily for interest calculation purposes. Bank savings accounts vary, but most only add your interest per month, so that’s another advantage of AQRU.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Join AQRU today!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you really wanted a good game of “Where’s Wallet?”, then try searching on the app store. There’s a seemingly infinite array of DeFi Wallets! But don’t worry, we’re here to resolve your bewilderment.</p>
<h2>What to look for when selecting a Crypto Wallet (DeFi Wallet Characteristics)</h2>
<p>Assuming you’re not going to be using “a bit of paper” as your DeFi <a href="https://aqru.io/insights/crypto-wallets-explained/">wallet</a>, trust and security are the most important factors for your peace of mind. You need to be able to trust the people who programmed the wallet, and the wallet software itself. Is it well-written? How big is the userbase? Is there technical support? Read reviews, and read (recent) complaints.</p>
<p><strong>Most DeFi wallets are “hot” wallets, in that the app is internet-connected, but cold wallets are also available</strong>: these don’t stay connected to the internet, though they do need to be online while you use them to send tokens.</p>
<p>After that, your main concern would be what tokens are supported and what extra features are available. For example, can you buy or swap Crypto in the wallet? Does it connect to any exchanges? Does it have an address book or allow friendly Crypto address names? Does it lock your private keys in, or does it allow you to export them?</p>
<p>Let’s go through the top picks and have a look.</p>
<h3>Best for Bitcoin: Electrum</h3>
<p>Electrum is a “hot” wallet (internet-connected) by default and can be installed on Windows, Mac or Linux devices, as well as Android devices (but not iOS).</p>
<p>The installation process on a desktop is usually more complex than a mobile wallet app install.</p>
<p><strong>Electrum is a Bitcoin-only wallet</strong>, and is not as suited to newcomers as some other wallets, especially on desktops. But it is feature-packed, safe, fast and secure.</p>
<h3>Best for Ethereum and NFTs: MetaMask</h3>
<p>One popular wallet that’s easier to set up is Consensys’ <a href="https://metamask.io/download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MetaMask</a>. It’s available as a browser extension and as an app. You can use both at the same time, on the same wallet by creating a wallet in one installation, writing down the passphrase that it generates, and typing that into the other installation.</p>
<p><em>Important</em>: when you create a wallet in any wallet software, it makes you write down (on paper) a series of random words. This “secret passphrase” should be written down on paper and safely stored as if it was gold. Depending on how the passphrase is produced, it might also be used for importing your funds to other wallets, though that wallet would have to support all the coins your previous wallet did. It’s probably best not to try and move wallets around unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>MetaMask stores the collection of private keys and addresses that make up your wallet locally. This will likely be on your hard disk, but MetaMask can also connect to hardware wallets and act as an interface for them &#8211; more on this later.</p>
<p><strong>MetaMask has become the de facto standard for buying and selling NFTs</strong> (“non-fungible tokens”) and Security tokens. An example of an NFT site that uses MetaMask is OpenSea.io, and sites such as TokenSoft or INX Securities, that allow you to buy Security tokens (i.e. regulated digital stocks, shares and IPOs). These sites don’t store your tokens and ask permission to access your MetaMask if they need to do something financial.</p>
<p>As more and more sites do this, MetaMask is an essential install, though it’s not exactly newcomer-friendly. There’s much to learn about Ethereum transactions, approvals and signing.</p>
<p>While MetaMask only supports Ethereum, it supports the (many, many) coins that live on that blockchain, both large and small, most of them known as “ERC-20” tokens. Some coins that live on other blockchains (such as Bitcoin) have ERC-20 equivalents, such as wBTC (“Wrapped Bitcoin”). The main US Dollar stablecoins also live on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>Technical support on both Electrum and MetaMask is largely “ask the Internet”, who are largely helpful but do tend to miss the point.</p>
<h3>Best for risky DeFi activities: Trust Wallet</h3>
<p>If you really want to experience the sharp end of Crypto, then Binance Exchange’s “Trust” Wallet supports not only the usual Crypto but also coins and activity launched on its own “Smart Chain”. This (amongst other things) is home to a protocol called “Pancake” that has even riskier coins than those on exchanges!</p>
<p>So if you want to impress your friends with sentences such as “I checked my NFTs and my ATOM was 10% up, with my SushiSwap being 13% up, but there was a dump on my Synthetic and I might have to borrow from Compound”, then Trust Wallet will have you on your way.</p>
<h3>Best for the Security-conscious: Hardware Wallets</h3>
<p>It’s not paranoid to want to give extra safety to your Crypto.</p>
<p><strong>Hardware wallets from companies such as Ledger are USB sticks that have a PIN</strong>. They store your keys offline so that hackers can’t get into them and are as safe as you get in Crypto. Of course, the wallet also gives you a 12-word phrase so that you can restore it if the USB Stick breaks.</p>
<p>The good news is that if you know your addresses, you can receive Cryptocurrency without the stick being online (like you can receive post without being in the house).</p>
<p>Hardware wallets such as Ledger’s have browser-based applets to allow you to plug the stick in and access your funds. Also, some wallets such as MetaMask can be told to access your stick instead of a wallet on your hard disk.</p>
<p>So if you’re visiting a Web 3.0 site that uses MetaMask, you can point it to your stick.</p>
<h3>Other Wallets</h3>
<p>Cryptocurrency exchanges do have their own wallets supporting various tokens and protocols: while they are well-written and supported, they also have the express goal of locking you into their exchange, one way or the other. That’s capitalism!</p>
<h2>When is a Wallet not a Wallet?</h2>
<p>Technically, <strong>a wallet app isn’t a wallet when your keys are stored with the app provider rather than on your mobile phone</strong>. For example, at AQRU, we have an app that looks very much like a wallet in which you can <a href="https://aqru.io/earn-interest-bitcoin/">invest your Bitcoin</a>, <a href="https://aqru.io/earn-interest-ethereum/">Ethereum</a> or US Dollar Stablecoins and see them increase over time.</p>
<p>When it’s an Authorised Digital Assets Provider with top-quality security and enough assets to return your funds if they’re hacked, this is safe enough. Any lender paying you interest would want control of your coins: otherwise, it would be like a bank paying you interest on the money stashed under your bed!</p>
<p>So, if you’re looking to do more with your assets, why not <a href="https://app.aqru.io/register">sign up to AQRU</a> for free today and <a href="https://aqru.io/crypto-interest/">start earning interest on your Crypto</a>!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The financial world as you know it is full of finance that concentrates an enormous amount of power into a small number of hands, centralising it. The world of <a href="https://aqru.io/insights/what-is-defi/">DeFi</a> (which stands for “Decentralised Finance”) was created as a financial playground for ordinary folks, away from the control of Governments and the big banks.</p>
<p>In the early days of DeFi, there were many opportunities for people, but there were just as many pitfalls. If it were a playground, it would still have concrete flooring and sharp metal edges, and the swings would go right over the top pretty easily.</p>
<p>As the market has matured, increased amounts of regulation and a wave of serious financial companies have effectively sprinkled some wood chips and smoothed off some edges to make the playground more welcoming to newcomers. However, it still pays to stay off the highest climbing frames: falling is falling, and it still hurts.</p>
<p>The inviting playground roundabout in this scenario is “stablecoins”. They’re designed to mirror or track real-world assets. This requires the company issuing them to have enough assets to justify the stablecoins they issue.</p>
<p>There are stablecoins that track gold, some that track the Yen, or the British Pound, and the most popular ones track the dollar: <a href="https://aqru.io/earn-interest-usdc/">USDC</a> (US Dollar Circle – Circle is the company that issue the coins), a virtual dollar that’s backed by other Cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Cryptocurrencies such as <a href="https://aqru.io/earn-interest-bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://aqru.io/earn-interest-ethereum/">Ethereum</a> change value a lot (it’s why some people love them), and stablecoins, by design, don’t show that kind of “volatility”, unless the underlying asset is also volatile.</p>
<p><strong>To make passive income through DeFi, you need to decide whether you want to go Crypto or stablecoin</strong>. With Crypto, the asset value can change. This means you could make out like a bandit or lose your shirt depending on when you finally sell. Stablecoins don’t change in value against the real-world asset they’re shadowing.</p>
<p>Most DeFi is based on Ethereum, which is both a token and a platform. The “Ethereum” platform is where thousands of tokens live, including the most popular stablecoins.</p>
<p>Once you’ve made that decision, you would use the assets, or “tokens” you buy, and send them somewhere to make income.</p>
<p>Whatever solution you choose, you need to check what tokens they accept. Quite often, you can buy assets in an app itself, which saves a lot of hassle, time and transmission fees, and ensures compatibility.</p>
<h2>Showing interest</h2>
<p><strong>The least risky approach to earning a passive income through DeFi is to store your assets on a lending platform such as AQRU</strong>. In order to do so, you lend us your assets, and we use them for DeFi activities such as lending to Crypto businesses while giving you high-interest rates compared to those you would get on the high street.</p>
<p>The “stablecoins and interest” route is by far the most conservative investment approach in Crypto, but can still generate up to 7% returns. “Crypto and interest” is riskier in the short- and medium- terms compared to the long term, and platforms can give decent interest on that too, such as 1% &#8211; which is better than leaving it in your <a href="https://aqru.io/insights/crypto-wallets-explained/">wallet</a> earning nothing. You’ve got to make sure the company is trustworthy though: don’t be fooled just by a friendly app or nice-looking website. If you check out our credentials, you’ll see we’re leading the way in security.</p>
<h2>Staking out</h2>
<p>Another alternative approach to passive income through DeFi is “staking”.</p>
<p>It’s actually quite similar to the interest approach. The difference? To earn interest, you lend your money to a company, which then use it in DeFi activities and give you a reward. “Staking” involves you taking your coins out of circulation in exchange for rewards from the issuer of the coin.</p>
<p>Why on earth would an issuer of a coin want less of them in circulation? To increase demand and to make sure you can’t sell them and drive down the price.</p>
<p><strong>Staking is certainly a viable way of earning passive income through DeFi</strong>. But it’s not as “passive” as the interest route, and it locks your assets into one coin for potentially substantial amounts of time. Even choosing the coin is difficult: there are a myriad of tokens you could stake that exist purely to play you for a sucker. And you know what they say about putting your eggs into one basket…</p>
<p>What’s more, the rewards for staking are also not markedly different from the rewards on interest-bearing deposits being offered by companies such as AQRU.</p>
<h2>Farming ‘dem yields</h2>
<p>Some people just aren’t satisfied with the returns generated by just one strategy, so they join a lot of strategies together (including some very risky ones like P2P lending, in which anonymous people loan to other anonymous people – yes, that’s a thing).</p>
<p><a href="https://aqru.io/insights/what-is-yield-farming/">Yield farming</a> is using the benefits from one strategy to invest in another strategy so you can optimise profits.</p>
<p>The problem? Well, <strong>everything changes so fast in DeFi</strong> that today’s optimum solution is tomorrow’s problem child. It’s not really passive income if you have to spend all your time managing it! (the only thing that makes it passive is that the returns aren’t related to the many hours you spend doing it – you could earn nothing from many hours of work, or even lose money!).</p>
<p>“Aha”, I hear you say. “You’re only describing the problem so you can offer a simple solution!”. Well, yes, there are companies that do all the yield farming for you: but that functionally is no different to giving a company your money and them giving you interest in return, but with a much less transparent explanation of what they’re doing with your money. (“Hey, we do DeFi things. It’s too technical for you to understand!”).</p>
<p>Think about this, too: if a company such as AQRU is paying interest per day: then that interest is compounded per day – interest being paid on interest. That’s true, <strong>passive yield farming</strong>.</p>
<p>Though actively looking at your assets increase in real-time is kind of addictive, so be careful!</p>
<p>There are a ton of eccentric, clever and esoteric other ways to make money in DeFi, but they often have a few things in common: they’re not as easy as they sound, they’re less profitable than you think (because every time you move money around or make a trade you pay fees), and it’s very difficult to tell who’s honest from who isn’t unless you’re in the know.</p>
<p><strong>AQRU offers a no-strings, simple way to earn passive income from Decentralised Finance</strong>. With a website and an app, you get 10USDC invested immediately for <a href="https://app.aqru.io/register">signing up</a>. You can mix and match Crypto (which you can buy in the app through trusted provider <a href="https://www.moonpay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MoonPay</a> and save a ton of hassle – though like everywhere else, a transaction fee would apply for a Crypto purchase).</p>
<p>There’s also a $75 USDC referral bonus (subject to terms and conditions). You can withdraw your money at any time (free into regular currency, and a $20 fee for withdrawing into Crypto), and the minimum deposit is only 100 euros or equivalent. There are no deposit fees, so you can benefit from everything sent in. So, don’t miss out, <a href="https://aqru.io/crypto-interest/">earn interest with AQRU today</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Capital at risk</b>. You must be satisfied that this crypto offering is suitable for you in light of your financial circumstances and attitude towards risk. The price or value of cryptocurrencies can rapidly increase or decrease at any time. The risk of loss in holding cryptocurrencies can be substantial.
