										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The easiest way to think of <a href="https://aqru.io/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> is as “Smart Bitcoin”. But that undersells it. It originated with a vision from a Crypto enthusiast (and co-founder of “Bitcoin Magazine”), Vitalik Buterin.</p>
<p>Whereas Bitcoin’s Blockchain was essentially a globally-shared ledger and an alternative currency, <strong>Ethereum’s goal was to be a global computer</strong> (based on Blockchain principles) that could run apps and function as a DAO – a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (one that runs itself, and there’s no one organisation that has control over it).</p>
<p>How does it run itself? Ethereum is a giant computer (a “Virtual Machine”) powered by computers worldwide running the Ethereum software. The programs running on it are “Smart Contracts” &#8211; bits of code hosted on the Blockchain that perform specific functions such as “take this and pay all these people”, or “check the status of this, then send it to x”. It’s all automated, and anyone can see the code of the Smart Contracts. It doesn’t care who executes them, as long as all the conditions are fulfilled. You need to pay ETH to execute any Smart Contract, and that ETH payment is called “Gas”. Some other Blockchains have a literal “GAS” token for the same purpose.</p>
<p>The development of Ethereum was financed by a pre-sale of $18 million worth of tokens (called Ether, abbreviated to ETH). It was launched in 2015. Despite not being launched as a store of value, it became the second most popular store of value after <a href="https://aqru.io/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>.</p>
<h2>A Rocky Start – Ethereum and Security</h2>
<p>Ethereum as a Blockchain is as secure as Bitcoin’s: any tampering with transactions is impossible because that tampering will always be outvoted by the many other “miners” processing transactions.</p>
<p>However, the Smart Contracts – the code written by people who want to use the Blockchain for something – are always a potential weak point. They’re visible to all, but that “all” includes hackers, as well as people who might be motivated to fix a bug.</p>
<p>In 2016, a hacker removed $50 million of ETH from a venture fund by hacking a Smart Contract, and Ethereum developers had a dramatic battle between themselves over what to do about it. One set wanted to leave things as they were, and one set wanted to modify the Blockchain so that the $50 million was restored.</p>
<p>In the end, they had a vote and the fixers won the day. However, the non-fixers decided that they would split the Blockchain to maintain their own version of Ethereum: Ethereum Classic (ETC). The fixed Ethereum was the “official” version and took off. The classic version… not so much. Though it didn’t fail either.</p>
<p>There have been many “Smart Contract” hacks since, but none of them resulted in a similar earthquake.</p>
<h2>How is ETHER (ETH) Created?</h2>
<p><strong>Ethereum was originally designed to operate on the same Proof-of-Work principle as Bitcoin</strong>: computers around the world compete to solve a time-limited mathematical puzzle and earn the right to add a new block to the Blockchain in exchange for a reward in ETH. Other computers are then chosen to validate that transaction in exchange for a bit more ETH.</p>
<p>The puzzles come and go much quicker than with Bitcoin, for a supposedly faster network. However, this computationally intensive way of working has become a huge bottleneck, resulting in an overloaded network and sky-high gas fees: the Ethereum Blockchain now supports a vast array of tokens and activity, with much of DeFi (Decentralised Finance) resting on its back.</p>
<p>Also, while most of the electricity consumed solving the puzzles is from renewable sources, it’s still an environmental factor the world could do without.</p>
<h3>Fixing ETH</h3>
<p>To fix the problems with capacity and environmental footprint, <strong>Ethereum developers have been working since 2020 on ETH 2.0</strong>. There have been lots of improvements, but the main one is moving from Proof-of-Work (computation) to Proof-of-Stake.</p>
<h2>Staking a Claim</h2>
<p>ETH 2.0 replaces miners with “validators”: <strong>users who want to earn a share of the new ETH by validating transactions with their computer</strong>. To be a validator, they lock up some of their ETH so that it can’t be sold, moved or traded, and keep their computer running to validate transactions.</p>
<p>The Blockchain then continually chooses users to be that lucky validator and receive the reward. The more you stake, the better the chance you have. It’s like the old “Premium Bonds”, where you lock your money into bonds, and the computer chooses some bonds to win prizes. While you have the bonds, you’re entered into each draw, but you can still sell them to get your money back if you want (though ETH will have changed in value while locked away).</p>
<p>Staking ETH (once ETH 2.0 is fully functional) will be one way of earning money from Ethereum that has similar results to an <a href="https://aqru.io/crypto-interest/account/">interest-bearing account</a>. But, there’s no fixed rate and your return can vary depending on luck. However, to be a full validator, you will need a lot of ETH and to leave your computer running to validate transactions.</p>
<p>This will mean more staking pools, where you pool your ETH with others and everyone shares the validator money. This does put you at the mercy of a private company because they would be a middleman in the staking process.</p>
<p>ETH 2.0 was due for full launch in June 2022 but has been delayed.</p>
<p>Much of Decentralised Finance is also waiting for that development: there are other Blockchains competing with Ethereum, but the “unhackability” of the core Blockchain and the number of other users means that Ethereum is perceived as a safe option for mission-critical transactions. <strong>Ethereum is home, for instance, to many Stablecoins that track real-world assets</strong>: such as <a href="https://aqru.io/earn-interest-usdc/">USDC</a> (which track the US Dollar and are used instead of it in Crypto transactions).</p>
<h2>How do you Buy or Trade Ethereum?</h2>
<p>You can buy Ethereum in more and more places: even Paypal offers it now! The most common places to buy are:</p>
<h3>1. At AQRU</h3>
<p><strong>AQRU offers a simple and convenient way to buy and sell Ethereum</strong> through trusted payment provider MoonPay and is especially handy for <a href="https://aqru.io/crypto-interest/">investing your new Crypto stash</a> into AQRU’s Crypto funding services.</p>
<p>Centralised exchanges can be the cheapest way, but you can also easily incur withdrawal fees sending the Crypto somewhere useful, and it’s often safer and more convenient to buy from.</p>
<p>Low-fee exchanges might also be the cheapest place to exchange your ETH into other Crypto or sell back your ETH to USD or other “real” (fiat) currencies, though this does mean sending your ETH back into the exchange to sell, which is more transmission fees.</p>
<p>In centralised exchanges, the selling/buying process is also more complicated than the other options, since you have to understand the various types of orders and how to execute them.</p>
<p>Even if you have no intention of trading, it’s a good idea to register with an exchange ahead of time just in case, and to get a better idea of the whole Crypto process: for instance, what an order book looks like, what the price histories of the Cryptos are, etc. It’s even more fun when you’re just looking!</p>
<h3>2. At a Financial Service Provider such as Paypal or Wirex</h3>
<p>More pricey than an exchange with little transparency about the rate you’re getting, but it’s easier than an exchange with little transparency about the rate you’re getting.</p>
<p>You can buy, sell and swap between Cryptos easily on these platforms, but to use them in Ethereum services, they still need to be sent to a wallet.</p>
<h3>3. Using an in-app or in-wallet Provider</h3>
<p>The popular Ethereum wallet “MetaMask” interrogates a range of payment providers to get the “best” quote for swaps between ETH and a wide range of other Crypto, and links to third-party payment services for purchasing ETH.</p>
<p>Some Web 3.0 websites such as OpenSea (NFT marketplace) and INX Securities (digital security tokens – like stocks and shares on the Blockchain), link to MetaMask and access your local wallet rather than demanding that you send your tokens elsewhere.</p>
<h3>4. A Decentralised Exchange (DEX)</h3>
<p>It’s possible to <strong>buy, swap and trade ETH on a Decentralised Exchange</strong> that also has access to your local wallet rather than transferring your tokens to an exchange-owned wallet somewhere else. Some exchanges are “order book”, and run like a regular centralised exchange, and some are “swap” exchanges, where the software directly finds people who are offering compatible swaps (like ETH for USDC).</p>
<p>A good list of decentralised exchanges can be found <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/dex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Does Ethereum have Value?</h2>
<p>The traditional answer to this is that something is worth what someone is willing to pay for it. But <strong>the value of ETH is also built on its usefulness and vast network</strong>. The more it’s used, the more ETH has to be purchased to activate the Smart Contracts: and the supply isn’t infinite. Therefore, supply and demand kick in and the price tends to rise.</p>
<p>Also, Ethereum is the technology underlying many other financial instruments, all of which have value – for instance, the tokens that are hosted on it.</p>
<h2>Tokens, tokens, tokens</h2>
<p>We haven’t touched yet on how quite early on in the life of Ethereum, a standard called ERC-20 was established to standardise the specifications of tokens launched on the Blockchain. The launch of ERC-20 was the signal for a boom in tokens on the Blockchain.</p>
<p>Now you even get ETH-ised versions of coins from other Blockchains, such as wBTC (“Wrapped BTC”) so that Bitcoin/Ethereum trading can happen within the Ethereum environment.</p>
<p>Ethereum even has competing token standards for Security Tokens – that is, tokens intended to represent a share of something – like digital stocks and shares. ERC-1404 for example ensures that transfers can only happen between whitelisted addresses, solving many regulatory problems. It also allows tokens to be revoked, which means it’s also impossible to lose them or steal them.</p>
<h2>The Future of Ethereum</h2>
<p>Will demand for Ethereum continue to rise?</p>
<p>The eager wait for ETH 2.0 implies that it will, even in the face of competing Blockchains that also offer dApps (Smart Contracts with a user interface). If the digital security token market takes off and uses ETH 2.0, then you will see exponential growth.</p>
<p>So, promising lower fees, a lower environmental footprint, faster transmission rates and more facilities, it’s a big upgrade that needs to succeed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’re probably not new to Cryptocurrencies, but to recap: <a href="https://aqru.io/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> and <a href="https://aqru.io/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> are pure digital assets that exist to provide an alternative to traditional finance. Bitcoin (BTC) is primarily a digital ledger, designed as an alternative currency, and <strong>Ethereum (ETH) was designed as a giant virtual computer to allow other financial systems to exist</strong>: and boy, do they exist!</p>
<p>You can buy, sell and store both of these assets using wallets and exchanges that normally let you buy with anything from bank transfers, other digital assets, or even debit cards. At the time of writing (April 2022), one BTC is worth $43,000 and one ETH is worth $3,180. You can check the current prices at <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CoinMarketCap</a> – that should give you an idea about how much the price changes.</p>
<p>Check out our <a href="https://aqru.io/insights/category/ethereum/">blog articles</a> for more about buying and storing Ethereum and other digital assets.</p>
<p>There are two very big questions to answer in this blog:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is any Cryptocurrency a good investment compared to traditional finance investment options?</li>
<li>How does Ethereum compare as an investment vehicle compared to other digital assets such as Bitcoin?</li>
</ol>
<p>And one sub-question only you can answer, but we’re sure you’re on it already since you’re smart:</p>
<ol>
<li>“<strong>Is Ethereum a good investment vehicle for you</strong>?”</li>
</ol>
<p>We can’t advise you, but we can point out some things.</p>
<h2>Is Ethereum a good investment compared to regular financial instruments?</h2>
<p>Investment opportunities in traditional finance to retail investors tend to be anaemic at best. Savings accounts are all but worthless, for instance. Investment funds that use the stock market tend to underperform, and most of the gain is had by the fund managers, not regular folk.</p>
<p>It’s certainly true that developing markets offer better returns and more risk. <strong>Cryptocurrency is the ultimate developing market</strong>: Ethereum has been around since 2015 and is still going in 2022 with an amazing rate of return for early investors who got in and out at the right time (not so good for people who bought into the hype and sold in depression).</p>
<p>The reason Ethereum is worth anything at all is that the Ethereum “Blockchain” (which is a digital ledger and a huge virtual computer) requires users to use ETH (the native “currency”) to interact with “Smart Contracts” (bits of code stored in the Blockchain that do stuff).</p>
<p>So, users have to buy ETH and use it to pay “gas fees” (the fees required by Smart Contracts to run). ETH is used at a higher rate than it’s generated, and supply and demand do the rest. The fact that ETH is bought and sold on the open market means that people also buy/sell/borrow and lend it, this activity adding to the value.</p>
<h2>How does this compare with Bitcoin?</h2>
<p>People buy and sell Bitcoin primarily to use as a virtual currency or, more likely, a store of value. Rather than seeing them as competing investment options, <strong>the sensible option from an investing point of view is to see ETH and BTC as options in a diversified approach</strong>. ETH may have more upside than BTC because there’s a distinct possibility that usage will explode over time compared to Bitcoin. Bitcoin also has less risk attached than Ethereum at the time of writing because ETH has more direct competitors and its future depends on the success of an upgrade.</p>
<h2>Advantages of investing in Ethereum</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Ethereum is hugely successful and is the second biggest digital asset by market capitalisation. Some are predicting it will “flip” with Bitcoin to become the biggest.</p>
<p>This fundamental is persuasive in itself: the use cases and network effects of Ethereum increase every day.</p>
<p>In fact, Ethereum has become too successful for its own good. So many companies and people use it for so many things that transmission fees have become unreasonably expensive, and the speed of transaction processing has decreased. These things render it unsuitable (at the moment) for much further expansion.</p>
<p>But an upgrade is in progress: ETH 2.0. If ETH 2.0 delivers what’s promised, then it will combine massive new capabilities with trusted technology: <strong>a killer combination that could open the floodgates to traditional finance migrating to Ethereum</strong>.</p>
<p>For instance, stock markets could migrate companies to digital security tokens: there’s a whole host of practical money-saving reasons for doing that.</p>
<p>Ethereum has also survived the onslaught of regulators relatively unscathed, despite a lot of fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD).</p>
<p>Of course, like any investment, you’d pick your time to buy. Ethereum (like other digital assets) has good days and bad days, and you can keep an eye on sites such as CoinMarketCap to see which is which: this is useful even if you aren’t trading.</p>
<h2>Risks of investing in Ethereum – Asset Value</h2>
<p>In terms of asset value, Cryptocurrency is unregulated and volatile: and there are regular predictions from “experts” that it could crash to zero at any moment (all of which have been proved wrong for major Cryptos).</p>
<p>Also, bear markets with depressed pricing can be prolonged, and there’s no safety net – Crypto can (and has) dropped by 95% of its value (though incredibly picking it back up again a couple of years later).</p>
<p>In the long-term (with sensible entry and exit points), the major Cryptocurrency has generally gone up in price reflecting increased usage and (sometimes) increasing scarcity.</p>
<p>One other risk you can’t guard against is political/legislative risk. For much of its life, Crypto has been under attack from the traditional banking sector and the politicians they influence. In some countries, using it was banned (but no country could stop it from working!).</p>
<p>These days the main risk comes from regulators making Crypto laws that adversely affect activities on a Blockchain. But the days of fearing Cryptocurrency was going to be globally banned seem to be over.</p>
<h2>Risks of investing in Ethereum – Asset Safety</h2>
<p>When you buy Ethereum, you have effectively two choices of where to put it: (1) keep it local to you, or (2) trust someone else to hold it (such as an exchange, or a company offering Crypto financial services).</p>
<p>If you follow good practice, then you can minimise any risks that your funds are lost or hacked. The biggest risk being that of leaving your coins at an exchange, because exchanges are the biggest target for hackers.</p>
<p>If you have custody of your assets, make sure that it’s in a <a href="https://aqru.io/insights/the-best-cryptocurrency-wallets-for-defi/">reliable wallet</a> and that you have kept a record of any “key phrases” that the wallet gave you.</p>
<p>If you’re giving custody of your assets to another company, make sure they’re trustworthy and secure. Are they an authorised virtual assets provider? Who does their security? Have they been hacked before? What’s their trading history? The danger here is if companies crash.</p>
<h2>OK, Ethereum sounds good, now what?</h2>
<p>First of all, heed the warnings of the disclaimers: <strong>don’t borrow money to invest in Crypto</strong>. Don’t invest money you can’t afford to lose. Do your own research to see if investing in Crypto is right for you. Invest for as long a time period as you can: that gives you the maximum opportunity to judge your exit point.</p>
<p>Now, if you’re still here, how about checking out an easy option that allows you to buy and hold ETH with a trustworthy and reliable company with a long trading record? You might as well make your ETH work for you while you’re waiting for it to go to the moon!</p>
<p>Here at AQRU, we are an authorised virtual assets provider involved in Decentralised Finance that offers <a href="https://aqru.io/earn-interest-ethereum/">1% returns on Ethereum</a> (or <a href="https://aqru.io/earn-interest-bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>) that you lodge with us.</p>
<p>You can even save a lot of hassle and transmission fees by buying the Ethereum in the app through our third-party trusted provider MoonPay (fees apply for Crypto card purchases).</p>
<p>The only other fee is $20 for a withdrawal to Crypto (but free to withdraw to fiat currencies).</p>
<p>Other benefits include a flat rate on all your Crypto, and you can diversify with separate Bitcoin and US Dollar Stablecoin accounts (we offer up to 7% APY, compounded for those!).</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://app.aqru.io/register">sign up for free</a> in our app or website, and we will invest 10USDC for you to demonstrate how our system works. You can see your amount increasing every second (the yield is actually paid per day).</p>
<p>Once you’ve passed verification, the minimum amount you can deposit is the equivalent of 100 Euros, and there’s even a referral system that pays $75.</p>
<p>As a <strong>one-stop-shop for buying and investing ETH</strong>, give it a look. At least you can say it’s ETHical investing!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, you’re interested in <a href="https://aqru.io/ethereum/">Ethereum</a>: can’t say we blame you! And you want to make money? Well, we’re right there with you!</p>
<p><strong>Ethereum was the first “smart” Cryptocurrency</strong>. It was launched a few years after <a href="https://aqru.io/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>, which is the granddaddy of Cryptocurrency and still the market leader.</p>
<p>Ethereum is purely digital and exists in digital space as a huge virtual system, maintained by computers all over the world. Unlike Bitcoin, which was designed to be a replacement for traditional currencies, Ethereum was designed to be a world computer capable of running applications and hosting financial systems.</p>
<p>The Ethereum “Blockchain” supports not only the usual ledger entries and addresses that can store quantities of tokens (like Bitcoin), but also supports “Smart Contracts” – that is, bits of code for specific tasks: such as “check that input against a list, and send funds to this list of addresses if it’s OK”.</p>
<p>The whole system runs on Ether (ETH) – the native token of the Ethereum Blockchain. ETH is used to pay the Blockchain to run the Smart Contracts, called a “Gas Fee”. These fees are also payable in ETH when you move other tokens around.</p>
<p>Tokens? Yes, and lots of them. Tokens are like Cryptocurrencies but they live on someone else’s Blockchain: in this case, Ethereum.</p>
<p>Because <strong>Ethereum is a smart Blockchain</strong>, it’s capable of being programmed to support many different business rules (called “Tokenomics”). There are thousands of these, from single unique tokens (called NFTs – “Non-Fungible Tokens”) to security tokens (a bit like digital stocks and shares), to Stablecoins (coins that exist to represent a real-world asset digitally, such as the US Dollar, or gold). Ethereum is also a key home to third-party protocols allowing Ethereum users to “be their own bank” – DeFi (“Decentralised Finance”).</p>
<p>Ethereum has been wildly successful, which has brought a wide range of problems too.</p>
<h2>Moneymaker 1: Mine!</h2>
<p>In its initial form (ETH 1.0), <strong>ETH is generated by “mining”</strong>: where computers worldwide compete to solve a mathematical puzzle to earn the right to process transactions for a fee. This uses a lot of power: and though 70% of Crypto mining uses renewable energy, it’s still a bottleneck. Currently, this is leading to high gas fees. This mining process is called “Proof of Work”, because computers are using their work (and electricity) to earn new ETH.</p>
<h3>How can you make money?</h3>
<p>There are mining companies such as <a href="https://shamining.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shamining</a> that allow you to rent processing power from them that they put to use in “mining pools”. This earns you a share of the Ethereum earned by that pool.</p>
<p><em>Pros:</em> Easy to start and deposit any amount you like.</p>
<p><em>Cons:</em> Ethereum 2.0 is going to put an end to mining Ethereum, mining companies are unregulated, you never get your mining fee back, and the ETH generated varies in value.</p>
<h2>Moneymaker 2: Everything’s at Stake!</h2>
<p>The problems with speed, capacity and “Proof of Work” prompted Ethereum developers to plan out an Ethereum 2.0 (ETH 2.0). The upgrade is faster and moves to a concept called “Proof of Stake”, which is a lot kinder to the environment.</p>
<p>Instead of powerful computers competing to solve puzzles to earn the right to process transactions, users of the system called “validators” lock up (“stake”) a certain number of ETH to earn that right. They also have to keep a system running 24 hours a day to process the transactions.</p>
<h3>How can you make money?</h3>
<p>Despite the fact that ETH 2.0 is not fully launched, it’s still possible to <strong>stake ETH and make a return</strong>: according to the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/staking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official status panel</a>, staking is currently returning about 4.5% per year for validators.</p>
<p>Note that the ETH stake is still yours, so you benefit/suffer from any underlying value changes.</p>
<h4>Solo Home Staking</h4>
<p>This is where you have to commit 32ETH, and also commit to running the Ethereum software 24/7 in case you’re picked to validate transactions.</p>
<p><em>Pros:</em> It’s just you and the Blockchain: there’s no other company involved (i.e. no KYC or AML, though most ways you’d buy the ETH would require that).</p>
<p><em>Cons:</em> It requires you to commit 32 ETH: that is a lot of ETH (over $96,000 worth). This is equivalent to you investing $96,000 into a 4.5% interest-bearing account, but you stand a chance of losing out if your system goes offline.</p>
<h4>Staking as a Service</h4>
<p>You can give someone else your 32 ETH and they will run the software for you.</p>
<p><em>Pros:</em> You don’t have to run a validator</p>
<p><em>Cons:</em> Still costs 32 ETH. Obviously, this is a chargeable service so there would be fees. Also, you have to trust the company providing the service.</p>
<h4>Pooled Staking</h4>
<p>This is where staking becomes viable for everyone. You can <strong>put in as little as you like, and get a share of the rewards</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Pros:</em> Accessible, lots of options. You keep control of your Crypto.</p>
<p><em>Cons:</em> This isn’t native to the Blockchain, so you’re relying on the integrity of a third-party company. Still only 4.5% return according to Ethereum’s own figures.</p>
<h4>Centralised Exchanges</h4>
<p>Some exchanges offer (or will offer) the chance to stake the ETH you just bought with them.</p>
<p><em>Pros:</em> An easy and affordable option.</p>
<p><em>Cons:</em> Return only 4.5% (if you even get that), the exchange has control of your Crypto, and exchanges are giant targets for hackers.</p>
<h2>Moneymaker 3: Buy and Hold</h2>
<p>This is probably the simplest option to understand, though there is a question of where to buy, and where to hold!</p>
<h3>ETH: is it actually worth anything?</h3>
<p>But first: if you’re about to buy a load of Ethereum: is it actually worth anything? Is it just hype? Or is there something behind it?</p>
<p>Well, one thing about the hype process is that it tends to be short-lived: just look at the craze around NFTs, for instance.</p>
<p>Ethereum has been functioning and growing since 2015, and its functioning needs people to buy ETH. The bigger the Blockchain gets, the more ETH is needed, and the price tends up over time. It’s supply and demand.</p>
<p>Unlike Bitcoin (max: 21 million coins), there’s no theoretical maximum amount of Ethereum that can exist. But there’s a finite supply at any given point. Demand greatly outstrips supply because Ethereum is useful. So, it’s worth something. Also, no hype can last 7 years and counting!</p>
<h3>HODLing Time</h3>
<p>All of the other options excluding mining involve actually buying ETH, so the big question is: is the underlying investment worth it?</p>
<p><strong>ETH has historically gone up over the long term</strong>, though there have also been years where you’d have lost 90% of the value of your holdings (these were recovered later, but it took a long time).</p>
<p>If ETH 2.0 is a success, you’d expect ETH to be worth a lot more than it is now as more and more finance options jump on it. If ETH 2.0 is a failure, there might be a slow decline as activities move to a new Blockchain.</p>
<p><em>Pros:</em> HODLing as a strategy doesn’t involve trusting anyone if you’re keeping it in your own wallet.</p>
<p><em>Cons:</em> Unlike the other strategies, it doesn’t generate any income.</p>
<h2>Moneymaker 4: Trading</h2>
<p>The concept is simple: buy low, sell high! And do it at an exchange that charges low fees and has a good order book, otherwise, you’re punished for every move you make! INX Crypto is the lowest fee exchange, but there are others, such as Coinbase, Binance, Gemini, Bittrex, Bitstamp and more.</p>
<p>But should you trade? <strong>While good Crypto tends to appreciate over the long-term, on a day-to-day basis, its value is all over the place</strong>. Unfortunately, the tools that might help you in a traditional finance environment (such as “Technical Analysis”) are much less help in Crypto because external events are more common, and the ability for a flurry of atypical orders to affect the price is larger.</p>
<p>You can make a lot of money stuck in front of a screen getting lucky: but you can lose a lot of money stuck in front of a screen getting unlucky.</p>
<p>As with all investments, if you do this, make sure it’s with money you’re prepared to lose! And make sure you do the maths so you’re not losing your profit in exchange fees.</p>
<p><em>Pros:</em> Nerve-tingling excitement 24/7. You could make a lot of money.</p>
<p><em>Cons:</em> Nerve-tingling excitement 24/7. You could lose a lot of money.</p>
<h2>Moneymaker 5: Earn Interest on your ETH</h2>
<p><em>Pros:</em> Simple. Guaranteed returns are larger than staking and mining.</p>
<p><em>Cons:</em> You’ve got to trust the company.</p>
<p>Of all the options that involve making money on ETH, the simplest one with the best return is to leave your ETH with a company that pays a guaranteed return: or even, buy the ETH in-app to avoid transmission fees: something you can do with a credit card.</p>
