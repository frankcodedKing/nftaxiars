										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Any wealth manager will tell you that wealth isn’t what you have: it’s about the income it generates. And for most investments, that means dividends (for securities), interest (for currencies or Cryptocurrencies), or appreciation in value (such as Fine Art or Gold).</p>
<p>Regular money left sitting anywhere is devalued by the day, regular interest rates are poor, and banks are greedy, so putting your assets into a “store of value” is a good first step.</p>
<p><em>Of course, it goes without saying that you should never invest money you can’t afford to lose, whether it’s in Cryptocurrency or the regular markets.</em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin is a “store of value”.</h2>
<p><a href="https://aqru.io/earn-interest-bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>, created in response to the financial crisis of 2008, is Cryptocurrency’s King Kong – the first, and the biggest. It’s often called “digital gold”.</p>
<p>Bitcoin goes up and down in value day-to-day, sometimes by a lot. But <strong>Bitcoin has always increased in value over the longer term</strong>, despite ups and downs.</p>
<p>This is partly built-in. For starters, there’s a limited maximum number of Bitcoins: 21,000,000. There will never be more than that, it’s technically impossible. This means scarcity. Banks can print money, but no one can print Bitcoin. Now the regulations around Bitcoin have been made considerably clearer, much of the worry about “will Bitcoin be here tomorrow?” has gone.</p>
<h2>How do they make Bitcoin?</h2>
<p>How do Bitcoins get created or issued? The process is called “mining” – Bitcoins are “found” by making computers solve maths puzzles by brute force. This uses electricity, and this process essentially converts electricity to Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Also, it gets harder and harder to “mine” them over time, because the difficulty ramps up every so often as the system requires more and more accuracy to find a Bitcoin. These days it’s so hard that people have to create “mining pools” to look for Bitcoins and share any they find.</p>
<h2>How do you make Bitcoin? Bitcoin savings accounts!</h2>
<p>Luckily for you, there’s an easy way to make Bitcoin for yourself: <strong>open a Bitcoin savings account and start earning interest on your Bitcoin</strong>. What kind of rates? Substantially more than banks are offering!</p>
<p>How is this possible? Well, it’s good old capitalism. Top-rated Bitcoin savings account provider AQRU is refreshingly transparent about how it does it and you can learn more about the process <a href="https://intercom.help/aqru-finance/en/articles/5682990-how-we-generate-the-high-rates-of-return" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Because Cryptocurrency is a young market, businesses raising funds in Cryptocurrency have less choice and less flexibility. That means that interest rates charged to them can be larger than interest rates that might be charged by banks (although not much higher, because banks demand huge profit margins). AQRU builds a business by passing that interest on to you, in exchange for being able to lend out your tokens.</p>
<h3>How do I get started?</h3>
<p>It all starts with a visit to <a href="https://aqru.io/">our website</a>, or downloading the AQRU app from your favourite app store (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1576493853" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.accru" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>).</p>
<p>AQRU&#8217;s easy-to-use app allows you to buy, invest and <a href="https://aqru.io/crypto-interest/">earn interest on your Crypto assets</a>. Not only is the annual interest paid daily, but you can also track it to the second on the app.</p>
<p>There’s also a great incentive to try it &#8211; it’s free to sign up!</p>
<p><b>“Try for free with 10 USDC on us.”</b></p>
<p>What’s a USDC? Cryptocurrency has a few tokens called “Stablecoins” whose job is to track the value of another asset. Other goodies AQRU are throwing your way include a $75 referral bonus paid in USDC (T&amp;Cs apply, naturally).</p>
<h3>Get verified and you’re almost there!</h3>
<p>Once you have passed the “Know Your Customer” and Money Laundering checks (never trust any organisation that skips these!), then AQRU puts 10 USDC into your account and you can instantly see it earning interest.</p>
<h2>But what of Bitcoin?</h2>
<p><strong>AQRU offers a Bitcoin pool giving 1% return on your Bitcoin</strong>. That’s an unconditional 1% that applies however much you put in.</p>
<p>Some other providers require you to invest in their own tokens before giving you their best interest rates, or require you to lock up your funds to take advantage of their headline rates.</p>
<p>Other gotchas that AQRU avoids are:</p>
<ol>
<li>fees on deposits (AQRU has none),</li>
<li>large minimum deposits (AQRU’s is the equivalent of 100 Euros)</li>
<li>fees on withdrawal to Fiat (i.e. regular money).</li>
</ol>
<h3>How do I get money in?</h3>
<p>The app and website both guide you through the process of putting money in, and you can use debit cards and bank transfers.</p>
<p>You can also <strong>deposit Bitcoin you already own from wallets or exchanges</strong> (we’ve put together a friendly introduction to Crypto wallets which you can find <a href="https://aqru.io/insights/crypto-wallets-explained/">here</a>).</p>
<p>If you want to get started really quickly then AQRU has teamed up with trusted payment provider “MoonPay” so that you can buy Bitcoin and put it straight into your Bitcoin pool with no messing (transaction fees may apply if you’re transferring from another wallet).</p>
<p>See our guide on how to invest your funds and start AQRUing <a href="https://intercom.help/aqru-finance/en/articles/5695128-how-to-invest-your-funds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Any fees I should be aware of?</h3>
<p>When you withdraw funds from the platform there is no fee for fiat withdrawals (i.e. withdrawals to “regular” currency). There is a $20 fee for Crypto withdrawals, charged in the asset you are withdrawing.</p>
<h3>Is my stuff safe from hackers?</h3>
<p>Yes, AQRU uses leading wallet infrastructure provider <a href="https://www.fireblocks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fireblocks</a> to ensure security of assets. We also have a $30 million policy in the event assets are stolen.</p>
<h4>Is my stuff safe from you?</h4>
<p>Yes! And we’re not offended you asked!</p>
<p>Accru Finance Ltd. is an Authorised Digital Assets Provider, registered in Bulgaria. Accru Finance Ltd. (Bulgaria) is a subsidiary of Accru Finance Ltd. (UK), a private limited company registered in England and Wales (registration no. 13133682).</p>
<h2>What other coins do you accept?</h2>
<p>You can also deposit or <a href="https://aqru.io/earn-interest-ethereum/">invest in Ethereum</a> (ETH) or multiple stablecoins (<a href="https://aqru.io/earn-interest-usdc/">USDC</a>).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://aqru.io/earn-interest-bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> was born of noble intentions (some of which are still valid!). However, these days, it’s mostly looked upon as an alternative investment opportunity and a chance to make money.</p>
<h2>But what is Bitcoin?</h2>
<p>Bitcoin is a virtual currency. It exists purely in the digital domain and acts as a “store of value” and as a digital currency. It’s not centralised and is independent of Government control (even if the people who use it aren’t!).</p>
<p>Part of its monetary value is based on its scarcity. There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins that are built into the rules of the coin itself (onto its “blockchain”). Another part of its value is based on the amount of electricity required to “mine” one. <strong>The first way you can make money from Bitcoin is by “mining” new ones</strong>: at the time of writing, they’re worth $44,000 each. It’s lucky they’re subdivided into a unit called “Satoshis” (SATs for short) so that you can own less than one Bitcoin.</p>
<h2>Mining</h2>
<p>Bitcoin is “mined” by being the first to solve a mathematical puzzle by brute force. In the old days, way back in 2009, you could let your laptop run collecting Bitcoin. Then you’d probably have lost interest (because it wasn’t worth anything then) and lost the wallet. It happened a lot more often than you’d think.</p>
<p>As with most things in life, there’s a hard way to mine Bitcoin, a less hard way, and an easy way.</p>
<p>The hard way is to buy the equipment needed and set it up to run 24/7. One problem is that the level of difficulty is much higher than it was, so the chances of one person running one piece of equipment and finding a Bitcoin are pretty much zero. Plus, the equipment drinks electricity. There’s a reason why 70% of Bitcoin is mined with renewable energy: it’s much cheaper!</p>
<p>The less hard way is the same as the hard way, except you join forces with others to mine Bitcoin together in a “pool”. When one finds a Bitcoin, the pooling software divides it according to how much everyone contributes to the pool. This still requires you to run an expensive electricity-sapping box 24/7.</p>
<p>The easy way is to join a cloud mining company. For a flat fee or subscription (depending on the company), you can rent computing power, and benefit from the Bitcoins mined by it.</p>
<p>While the return can be as high as 40%, there are some caveats. A UK-based cloud mining company, <a href="https://shamining.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shamining</a>, is one way you can get involved in this.</p>
<p>There are quite a few warnings though. Substantial investment is required to rent enough computing power. Unlike <a href="https://aqru.io/crypto-interest/">earning interest on Crypto</a>, you never get your initial stake given back: you just hope that it will earn enough Bitcoin to make you a profit or income. You also don’t know how difficult Bitcoin is going to get to find, or what price it will be.</p>
<p>Equally, the companies are unregulated because they’re offering a service for a fee, though the reputable ones will do Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti Money Laundering (AML) checking of customers. They can easily disappear overnight or just stop paying out. It has happened.</p>
<p>Maybe you’re not a “set and forget” type and you like the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat? In which case, trading may be an option for you.</p>
<h2>Trading</h2>
<p>Trading is rather like the lottery: your chances of making money are a lot less than you would instinctively believe, though, of course, <strong>it’s possible to make money if you successfully buy low and sell high</strong>. There are a number of things not working in your favour, though. There’s no safety net, your capital is most definitely at risk. The price can vary quite wildly, and you can find your investment worth 10% less in a matter of minutes. If you panic sell, and that’s locked in. Much of the time the Crypto moves sideways providing no profit whatsoever. Then it can move 10% up and back down again while you’re not looking…</p>
<p>The point is: trading is stressful and risky. If you must buy something at an exchange, then use the one with the least fees, an example is <a href="https://www.inx.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">INX Crypto</a>. Exchanges like Coinbase are well-known, but with much higher fees.</p>
<h2>Buy and HODL</h2>
<p>Or perhaps you want to just buy and not sell? “HODL” is reputed to stand for “Hold on for dear life”, though some think it’s just a typo.</p>
<p><strong>If you buy Bitcoin, your sole profit on that comes when you sell it again</strong>, hopefully for more dollars than you paid for it. Bitcoin generally goes up in the long-term (say, five years), but swings wildly in the short- and medium- terms (anything up to five years).</p>
<p>The cheapest way to buy Bitcoin would also be an exchange: you have much more control over the price you buy at, and the fees are cheaper. However, some of this cost advantage is lost if you need to send it anywhere else (such as to a <a href="https://aqru.io/insights/crypto-wallets-explained/">wallet</a> or lending app) because of transmission fees. Sometimes it’s cheaper to buy Bitcoin “nearer” to where you want to use it.</p>
<p>As a strategy, HODL is missing one thing: it doesn’t make your assets work. They just sit there. That’s where you can combine a HODL strategy with something more useful.</p>
<h2>Earning interest on your Bitcoin with AQRU</h2>
<p>If there’s such a thing as a passively active approach, AQRU is it. Our job (via app and website, free sign-up) is to do a similar thing in decentralised finance that banks do in the “real” financial system. That means borrowing resources from people like you (deposits), and then using our expertise behind the scenes to make more money: lending to businesses, providing liquidity to markets, etc. In return, <strong>we pay you a fee in the form of interest or yield</strong>.</p>
<p>The AQRU difference is that working in Crypto markets means there’s less cash floating about, and thus there’s more opportunity to charge a premium for lending it. Our promise of a 1% yield per year on Bitcoin (and <a href="https://aqru.io/earn-interest-ethereum/">Ethereum</a>) is sizeable compared to what’s currently on offer in the high street.</p>
<p>So, at AQRU, we are an Authorised Digital Assets Provider that can <strong>look after your Bitcoin and pay you an interest/yield of 1% per year</strong> without you having to do a thing.</p>
<p>We don’t lock up your money, charge a deposit fee, or charge a fee for withdrawing to a “fiat” currency. You can also see the interest being added in real-time, which is kind of fun! There is a $20 fee for withdrawing to a Cryptocurrency, which is our only fee.</p>
<p>If you invest in stablecoins (that is: coins that track assets such as the US Dollar and aren’t as volatile as regular Crypto), you can get up to a 7% yield, which compares astonishingly with the equivalent savings accounts in current markets.</p>
<p>You can even buy tokens in the app through our partnership with trusted provider MoonPay, and save some transmission fees.</p>
<p>We hope that you will consider the benefits of HODL+AQRU. To help you decide, you can <a href="https://app.aqru.io/register">sign up for free</a> and get a $10 USDC stablecoin investment made automatically. Once you’re verified, you can deposit using a debit card or bank transfer, use MoonPay or send in external Crypto. The minimum deposit is 100 Euro or equivalent. Don’t miss out, get started and <strong>start earning interest on your Bitcoin</strong> today!</p>
