										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Earning interest on your crypto assets is now so simple with AQRU, anyone can do it.</h2>
<p>We are super excited to launch our app, which for the first time makes <a href="https://aqru.io/">earning interest on your crypto</a> assets so simple; literally, anyone can do it.</p>
<p>Launching AQRU has been the culmination of months of work, late nights and early mornings from an experienced team of software developers and investment experts, whose primary goal is to make the <strong>high returns from the Crypto market</strong> accessible to anyone.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re delighted today to onboard the first of many users of our platform and to help them with their financial objectives by paying up to 7% on the assets they hold.</p>
<div class="video-wrap"><iframe loading="lazy" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ffc2S-PimFE" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<h2>Who is AQRU?</h2>
<p>AQRU, very simply put, is a place where retail and institutional investors can deposit an existing crypto portfolio or buy Crypto for the first time and start earning interest instantly.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re incredibly proud to be able to launch with not only access to our returns via our website but launching apps for iOS and Android, too, further cementing our commitment to make this the simplest and most accessible way to access high returns.</p>
<h3>How simple is it to earn interest using AQRU?</h3>
<p>As simple as registering for an account in 20 seconds, receiving a 10 USDC bonus to show you how it works, running a few checks, so we know who you are and where your money is coming from and then <strong>depositing either cash or Crypto</strong> into one of our investment products. Then you just watch the interest AQRU!</p>
<h2>Why AQRU?</h2>
<p>As a team who have worked together in the past in financial services, we had the opportunity to speak with over 10,000 people to identify pain points in their finances and build products that solve those issues. One consistent theme in our research showed that most people need to produce additional income to make money from their money but in a simple, <a href="https://aqru.io/insights/is-crypto-jargon-confusing-you/">jargon-free</a> way.</p>
<p>When we saw the emergence of decentralised finance in the last few years and the exceptional returns generated there, we decided we could build a platform that simplified all of these complex processes and made them accessible to everyone.</p>
<p><b>Phil Blows, CEO and Co-Founder said:</b>&#8220;We launched AQRU to be the most straightforward, safest place for anyone, regardless of their background or financial experience, to access market-leading returns on their investments. We are delighted to get the app in the hands of everyday users and play a part in helping them feel better about their finances.”</p>
<p><b>Digby Try, COO and Co-Founder said: “</b>When we saw the great returns available in Crypto but just how complicated and tricky it was we were driven to design AQRU, making it as easy as possible for people to start earning on Crypto assets. Our mission is to make it safe, secure and easy to understand so our clients can watch their money grow with peace of mind.”</p>
<p>We hope that with AQRU, we can disrupt the Crypto world with a regulation first approach that is safe, secure and reliable. AQRU was recently acquired, pre-launch by Dispersion Holding PLC., a publicly-traded company. In doing so, it has shown great confidence in the team behind the scenes to produce a first of its kind Crypto investment platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the early days of cryptocurrency, the biggest exchange on the block was Mt Gox. However, in 2014, Mt Gox went bankrupt after hackers stole 850,000 Bitcoins worth $34 billion in today’s prices. Insiders blamed a reckless culture and little internal controls with company and founder assets being mixed. The insolvency proceedings continue to this day with investors waiting on a decision about how much they can be compensated with whatever remaining assets survived.</p>
<p>Out of the wreckage of Mt. Gox many retail investors became warier about where they store their assets. However, to this day many people do little research before choosing an exchange or wallet to do their crypto investing. What then are the hallmarks of a bad provider?</p>
<h2>They don’t pay interest!</h2>
<p>If you <strong>have an account with one of the big crypto exchanges</strong>, they might offer to <a href="https://aqru.io/">pay interest on the crypto you hold</a> with them. This might not be easy to find on their site but that is often intentional. If you aren’t earning on the crypto you have deposited, then often the exchange is already doing it on your behalf and pocketing the earnings. At the time of writing, for Bitcoin, Binance are paying 1.20% and Coinbase is paying 0.11% via a connection to Compound Finance. Better than nothing, however, when compared to <strong>leading yield provider AQRU</strong>, which pay 1%, there are better places for your crypto.</p>
<h2>You don’t know who they are or where they are based</h2>
<p>Some of the <strong>largest exchanges in the world have opaque leadership structures</strong> and little transparency on where the business is based. This makes it very difficult to do any basic due diligence on them to see if they have adequate controls in place to hold customer assets.</p>
<h2>They aren’t regulated</h2>
<p>Crypto remains an emerging asset class and as such many governments around the world are yet to decide how they will regulate this industry. Regulation provides consumers with protection while reducing the incidence of money laundering and terrorist financing.</p>
<p>Many exchanges are doing their best to go above and beyond what is currently required by regulators and act in the best interest of their customers. Unfortunately, some of the world’s largest exchanges are going out of their way to avoid regulations with leaks of internal documents providing a fascinating insight into how some exchanges choose to operate: https://www.coindesk.com/binance-regulatory-evasion-tai-chi</p>
<p>If crypto is to become adopted by the masses, and a part of retail investors&#8217; portfolios, it is essential that controls are in place to ensure consumers are protected and we do not make it easier for criminals to integrate money into the system.</p>
<h2>They get hacked</h2>
<p>According to AtlasVPN, in 2020, over <strong>$300m was lost from exchanges that got hacked</strong>. Many of these exchanges were smaller, poorly funded companies that had set up too quickly with little to no controls in place. It is essential to do due diligence on any exchange that holds your assets to ensure they have been audited and have a proven track record of tech delivery.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that most assets that were stolen were from wallets. Many of which would have been classed as self-custody wallets connected to DeFi apps. Many promote self-custody as the safest vehicle available for investors to lodge their assets but the data shows there are still many risks out there.</p>
<h2>They are really complicated!</h2>
<p>Below are a few screenshots from some of the most popular crypto exchanges in the market. These platforms tend to be trader orientated encouraging people to jump in and out of investments frequently as it is the main revenue driver for exchanges. We also know that short-term trading often leads to poor investment performance. Traditional brokers such as IG Index in the UK state that 71% of investors lose money when investors use their service. Compare that with investors who adopted a buy and hold strategy and the performance is often very different.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The world of crypto remains a minefield for the uninitiated. When selecting an exchange make sure they are regulated, well-financed with an obvious HQ and leadership team, and paying decent levels of interest in crypto balances. If you wish to go the DeFi route, ensure the service used is well audited by several firms and that it has a decent track record of tech delivery. Previous events where the exchange was hacked aren’t necessarily a reason not to use them if they can demonstrate a robust response and consistent record since the event.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the 15<sup>th</sup> of September 2008, Dick Fuld, Chairman, and CEO of Lehman Brothers was having a bad day. Over the preceding decades, under his supervision, Lehman’s had walked a tightrope of extreme financial leverage driven by greed and poor risk management. Fuld was known for creating a ‘win-at-all-costs&#8217; culture which saw his traders expose the bank to greater and greater risk as they chased their next annual bonus payment.</p>
<p>In 2007, the subprime mortgage market began to collapse and customers, unaware of the small print in many of their <a href="https://aqru.io/insights/how-to-pay-off-your-mortgage-using-cryptocurrency/">mortgages</a>, started to default as interest payments skyrocketed. As a glut of property for sale hit the market, house prices continued to collapse with many borrowers finding themselves in negative equity.</p>
<p>Ultimately, those on the hook were the borrowers whose credit rating suffered and those who held the insurance products that paid out when the loans defaulted. As it happened, Lehman’s and many other investment banks had huge exposures to these insurance products and were in serious trouble.</p>
<p>As Lehman’s massive exposure became clear, the Federal Reserve summoned several banks to negotiate financing for its reorganization. These discussions failed, and Lehman filed a Chapter 11 petition that remains the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history, involving more than US$600 billion in assets.</p>
<p>What followed was a blood bath on Wall Street and around the world as central banks turned on the printing presses to pump liquidity into the market to stop the financial market from grinding to a halt. Incidentally, it was this huge monetary expansion that led to the increasing popularity of inflation-resistant cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin that have a fixed supply that cannot be changed.</p>
<p><strong>Why is this story relevant?</strong></p>
<p>May 2021 saw the cryptocurrency market suffer its largest liquidity crisis to date. The overall value of crypto almost halved in a little over a week reducing the value of holdings by as much as $750 billion.</p>
<p>Aave, Compound, and Maker are DeFi protocols that account for nearly 50% of all total value locked. According to DappRadar, they saw liquidations hitting a record of over $1.17 billion worth of collateral. Although these numbers are far smaller than what was seen in the financial crisis, they represent a significant proportion of the total assets that were locked in these protocols.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-217" src="https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2021/06/picture4-300x168.png" alt="" width="480" height="269" srcset="https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2021/06/picture4-300x168.png 300w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2021/06/picture4-320x180.png 320w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2021/06/picture4-600x338.png 600w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2021/06/picture4.png 602w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></p>
<p><strong>What w</strong><strong>as the result of this liquidation?</strong></p>
<p>Fortunately, for the major lending protocols, 100%+ collateral is still required to borrow money. This meant when the liquidations occurred, there was enough collateral to cover margin calls and no platform or service was left holding the bill. Effectively, the market, through, self-regulation weathered the storm.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It has long been argued that a government backstop for the traditional financial markets is a major cause of excessive risk-taking. If the banks get into a position where they are effectively bankrupt and pose a threat to the financial system, the banks know they will be bailed out by taxpayers. This heads I win, tails you lose scenario does not incentivise responsible market practices.</p>
<p>In the world of crypto, no government bailout would be forthcoming in events such as May. Market participants are required to manage their risk and make allowances for extreme market conditions or face being wiped out. This self-governance has now withstood a major market shock and its biggest test to date, and it is fair to say that it has performed well. Aave since the crash have seen assets top $20 billion, a vote of confidence in their protocol that bodes well for the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Are you getting a little bored of stocks?</h2>
<p>If you had invested in the FTSE 100 in January 2000 you would have bought it at a price of around 6930. At the time of writing, 21 years later, the same index is sitting at 7051. Fortunately, you would have received dividends which, had you reinvested and not been taxed on, would have boosted your return to 4% per year. Nothing to turn your nose up at but also nothing to get too excited about.</p>
<p>The last decade has also seen near zero interest rates so there is <strong>little yield available in the market</strong> with global bond funds also performing poorly in recent history.</p>
<h2>Is there a new asset class on the block?</h2>
<p>Cryptocurrency, the much derided and controversial new asset class, has been the clear leader in terms of investment returns over the past 5 years. However, the largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has a daily volatility of 1%+ which will keep you awake at night if any large portion of your net worth is sitting in it.</p>
<p>If cryptocurrencies are to become a core component of a diversified portfolio, they need a different approach and, unsurprisingly, we can learn some valuable lessons from the world of traditional portfolio management.</p>
<h2>Crypto Bonds (stablecoins)</h2>
<p>A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that has its value pegged to a real-world asset. For the purposes of this example, we would look at cryptocurrencies that have their value pegged to the price of USD or EUR. For every USD or EUR stablecoin there would be a USD or EUR sitting in a bank account to back it up.</p>
<p>These cryptocurrencies are nothing new with billions already in circulation. They are in high demand though from speculators and non-traditional borrowers who will pay high yields to borrow them for flexible time periods. Yields can be anywhere from 5-15% per year and the underlying asset fluctuates in line with the real-world currency.</p>
<p>In the recent market turmoil that saw cryptocurrencies drop as much at 60% in a little over a week, many investors reallocated capital into stablecoins to ride out the storm. Investors saw these assets, like bonds, as safe haven assets in times of financial turmoil.</p>
<h2>Crypto Equities (bluechip crypto)</h2>
<p>Bitcoin and Ether remain the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalisation. What many don’t know, is that they are also yield bearing assets. In terms of a return profile, the underlying asset (Bitcoin / Ether) is highly volatile, and you are hoping for capital appreciation, however, there is a stable income stream provided by the asset of anywhere between 2-1% in addition to any capital appreciation. This begins to look a lot like a dividend paying stock.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>With these two crypto ‘asset classes’ in mind, you can quickly see how one might construct a crypto portfolio that, depending on your view on where crypto prices are going, would vary its exposure to crypto bonds and crypto equities. When you are feeling bullish on the crypto market you would up exposure to ‘equities’ and when bearish move more into ‘bonds’ much like in traditional asset management.</p>
<p>The above is easier said than done. Getting <a href="https://aqru.io/">decent yields on your crypto</a> can be complex, expensive and risky to the uninitiated. It is for this reason that we created AQRU. Our Auto AQRU product allows you to deposit fiat and invest in either stablecoin or BTC/ETH strategies. Funds can be removed at any time so you can switch asset classes daily if desired all from one simple-to-use platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wouldn’t it be amazing to be mortgage-free? For many people, <strong>paying off their mortgage</strong> is the catalyst for early retirement or going part-time and spending more time doing what they want. For many, this is only something they will experience in their late 60s or early 70s depending on how their careers progress. However, new innovative strategies within emerging asset classes such as cryptocurrency are providing hope for millions.</p>
<p>According to finder.com the average UK mortgage is £137,934, which, if we assume an interest rate of 4.5% will cost £767 per month to pay off over 25 years. Is there a way to pay this off faster?</p>
<h2>What are stable strategies in crypto?</h2>
<p>When you think of cryptocurrencies you probably think of the wild price swings attributed to Bitcoin or the latest dog-related meme coin. Although, all cryptocurrency is rightly classified as high risk, there are lower-risk strategies within this asset class. One of these is using stablecoins.</p>
<p>Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the price of a real-world currency such as the Euro or Dollar. To create a stablecoin, fiat currency is deposited into the issuer&#8217;s bank account and held in trust. The issuer then creates a coin related to that real-world asset and assigns it to the buyer by updating the blockchain record. To redeem the real-world asset the reverse process occurs. As a retail investor, you wouldn’t have to do this process as it is most likely taken care of by the platform on which you are investing. It is always good to understand the mechanics though.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-209" src="https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2021/06/picture3-300x231.png" alt="" width="470" height="361" srcset="https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2021/06/picture3-300x231.png 300w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2021/06/picture3-320x247.png 320w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2021/06/picture3.png 602w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></p>
<p>These stablecoins are extremely useful for institutions trading and investing in the crypto market and are in high demand. As such, they can be lent out to generate a yield. AQRU is a <a href="https://aqru.io/">market-leading provider of yield on cryptoassets</a> and will pay 15% per annum on the value of your stablecoin investment. It is this return that we will use to help pay off our mortgage.</p>
<h2>Strategy 1: Switch to interest only and compound</h2>
<p>We have already seen in our example that a £137,934 mortgage requires a monthly payment of £767 per month for 25 years or a total of £230,100.</p>
<p>What would happen if we switched to an interest-only mortgage and put the saving into the stablecoin strategy?</p>
<p>An interest only mortgage would cost us £517 per month, leaving us with £250 per month (£767-£517). If we invested this at 15% after 14 years, we would have a pot worth £141,211.25. The mortgage would be paid off with money to spare 11 years earlier saving us a total of £101,244.</p>
<p>This is an amazing outcome but there are multiple risks to consider including the security of your crypto, the solvency of the firm you are dealing with, and the underlying stablecoin risks. For this reason, ensure you are dealing with a regulated and preferably insured cryptocurrency provider. There are also tax implications that you would need to consider.</p>
<h2>Strategy 2: Crypto Side Car</h2>
<p>In this scenario you continue with your repayment mortgage, however, you <strong>set up a separate ‘side car’ or crypto investment account</strong>, that you deposit money into each month. Let us say you deposit £100 per month into your sidecar and invest it for a 15% return.</p>
<p>After 16 years, your mortgage balance that still needs to be repaid is £69,951 and your savings balance is £78,883.26. At this point, it is up to you whether you pay off your mortgage.</p>
<p>If, for argument&#8217;s sake, we did not immediately pay off our mortgage and instead continued to pay it off monthly as well as investing £100 per month into our sidecar, how would we be left after 25 years?</p>
<p>As per the mortgage term, the debt would be paid off. In addition, the £100 per month invested for 25 years in the 15% account would now be worth £324,352.96. A nice little nest egg for retirement.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>All these strategies come with significant risk as they are investing in new asset classes. Hopefully, the examples above will give you food for thought when tackling some of your biggest financial commitments. AQRU’s aim is to become <strong>the safest place to earn a yield on your cryptocurrency</strong>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What interest are you currently earning on your crypto?</h2>
<p>When I ask people this question I usually get met with a blank stare. The vast majority of crypto holders are not <a href="https://aqru.io/">earning interest on their coins</a> and, worse yet, most don’t even realise that they can. This lack of knowledge is costing people millions every day. If you&#8217;re not <strong>earning money on your crypto</strong>, you&#8217;re doing it wrong!</p>
<h2>Why aren’t more people shouting about this?</h2>
<p>Unless you are experienced in the world of crypto, you are probably holding your coins wherever you chose to buy them. The market leaders are <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a> and <a href="https://www.binance.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> and they hold a large amount of the cryptocurrency bought by retail investors. Many <strong>exchanges will pay you interest on your coins</strong>, but these services tend to pay low yields and are buried behind complex user experiences that are designed to get you to buy and sell as much as possible as this is where exchanges make their money.</p>
<p>The other reason exchanges are not telling you to earn interest on your coins is because they are already doing it on your behalf and pocketing the earnings! The more people who understand this the more money it will cost exchanges as customers move their assets seeking the best returns for their holdings.</p>
<h2>How much are you missing out on?</h2>
<p>Let us take the example of bitcoin:</p>
<p>Say you bought 1 Bitcoin 3 years ago for $8,000. Now, at the time of writing, it would be worth $40,000.</p>
<p>What would be the difference if you had bought the same Bitcoin and transferred it to leading crypto yield provider AQRU?</p>
<p>AQRU, pays <strong>1% annually on Bitcoin balances</strong> so instead of 1 Bitcoin after 3 years you would have 1.23 Bitcoin worth $49,200 today. That is a pretty big difference for little to no effort.</p>
<p>Let us take the example a little further. If you are bullish on the long-term price appreciation of Bitcoin, how would this interest play out in the long run? In a scenario where Bitcoin hits $500,000 in 2025 as per the ‘stock to flow’ model that many Bitcoiners follow, how would interest change your outcome?</p>
<p>Source: https://stats.buybitcoinworldwide.com/stock-to-flow/</p>
<p>The 1 Bitcoin you bought in 2018 would be worth 1.63 Bitcoin in 2025 or $815,000 vs $500,000 if you had left it somewhere it was not earning interest.</p>
<p>Much like the traditional world of finance, it pays to be well informed about how you manage your money. Now more than ever where the world of finance is seemingly being upended by Blockchain we must <a href="https://aqru.io/insights/how-to-pay-off-your-mortgage-using-cryptocurrency/">learn about the opportunities available</a> in emerging assets classes or risk being left behind.</p>
<p>However, the world of crypto is a complex place arguably filled with more <a href="https://aqru.io/insights/is-crypto-jargon-confusing-you/">jargon</a> than the traditional world of finance and mistakes can be extremely costly. Many lack the time or capital to learn new financial skills and it is this problem that is being solved by AQRU.</p>
<p>AQRU gives customers an <strong>insured, simple to understand platform</strong> where they can deposit fiat by card or bank transfer, convert it into cryptocurrency, and immediately begin earning market-leading yields of up to 15%. Rewards can be converted back to fiat and removed daily. It has never been easier to make the most of your cryptocurrency or get involved for the first time. If you haven&#8217;t already, <a href="https://app.aqru.io/register">sign up</a> and start earning higher rates of interest today!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my younger days I used to trade absolute return strategies, looking to capture alpha from mean reversion in highly correlated stock pairs. The strategies we employed had high sharpe ratios and low beta to indices and other major asset classes.</p>
<p>The traditional world of finance is full of confusing <a href="https://aqru.io/insights/is-crypto-jargon-confusing-you/">jargon</a> like the above aimed at making the protagonist appear intelligent. They could easily have said, ‘when two things that have generally followed each other in price move in different directions, buy the cheap one and sell the expensive one,’ however that lacks the gravitas of the previous explanation.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency was always touted as an inclusive asset class in which anyone, regardless of economic standing or geography could participate. Open, peer-to-peer networks meant, for the first time, that the whole world could access an ‘internet of value’.</p>
<p>However, crypto has quickly created its own jargon as equally confusing and cliquish as that created by the Ivy Leaguers of the traditional world of finance. Take the below Twitter conversations:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-201" src="https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2021/06/picture1-300x153.png" alt="" width="300" height="153" srcset="https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2021/06/picture1-300x153.png 300w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2021/06/picture1-320x164.png 320w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2021/06/picture1-600x308.png 600w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2021/06/picture1.png 602w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-200" src="https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2021/06/picture2-300x130.png" alt="" width="300" height="130" srcset="https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2021/06/picture2-300x130.png 300w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2021/06/picture2-320x138.png 320w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2021/06/picture2-600x260.png 600w, https://aqru.io/app/uploads/2021/06/picture2.png 602w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Confusing for the uninitiated! With this in mind we thought it might be useful to deconstruct some of the more common terms. For a full breakdown check out this <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">great guide by Coinmarketcap</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Stables / Stablecoins</strong> – these are cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to that of a real world asset. The most common are US dollar cryptocurrencies like USDC. Their value tracks the price of a dollar. Stablecoins could, however, be pegged to anything from property, art or music rights.</p>
<p><strong>LP / Liquidity provider</strong> – these are exchanges where you can buy or sell crypto. You can get LP tokens when you, as an investor, provide liquidity to exchanges. These can then used to generate yield.</p>
<p><strong>Farm / Yield Farming</strong> – this is where investors use their cryptocurrency holdings to stake assets with decentralised exchanges to earn yield. The farming acronym is useful as you ‘harvest’ returns and use them to grow additional returns.</p>
<p><strong>Leverage</strong> – using borrowed funds to enhance the profit / loss of an investment</p>
<p><strong>FUD</strong> – ‘Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt’. You will see this thrown around as a derogatory term on Twitter when people are talking down crypto.</p>
<p><strong>Diamond Hands</strong> – those who never sell even as markets are collapsing</p>
<p><strong>HODL</strong> – ‘Hold on for dear life’ attributed to an early Bitcoin forum where someone spelt hold wrong!</p>
<p><strong>Mooning / send it</strong> – coins that are appreciating rapidly or about to.</p>
<p><strong>Degens</strong> – is a collective term for the participants of early DeFi project. They can usually be found causing trouble on Telegram and Discord, where they share information about new DeFi projects through which they think they can generate profits.</p>
<p>The list goes on and on but it is fair to say that if you want to stay up to date with crypto you need to engage with the culture that is being created or risk being left behind. Crypto remains <strong>an excellent place to find high yielding investments</strong> if you understand the risks that are present. AQRU engages with multiple DeFi services to deliver the best yields to <a href="https://aqru.io/">earn interest on crypto</a> for its customers, all with a simple, jargon free user experience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If your crypto is currently sitting on one of the big exchanges, you are undoubtedly missing out on a lot of income. How much? According to stakingrewards.com the <strong>average interest earned across 9000+ providers on cryptocurrencies is 14.95%</strong>. At that rate, you can double the amount of crypto you hold every 4 years without doing anything.</p>
<p>What are the best ways to do it then?</p>
<h2>Lend it to your broker</h2>
<p>If you have an account with one of the big exchanges, they will offer to <a href="https://aqru.io/">pay you interest on the crypto you hold</a> with them. This might not be easy to find on their site but that is often intentional. If you aren’t earning on the crypto you have deposited, then often the exchange is already doing it on your behalf and pocketing the earnings. At the time of writing, for Bitcoin, <a href="https://www.binance.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> is paying 1.20% and <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a> is paying 0.11% via a connection to Compound Finance. Not great but one of the easiest options for crypto novices to use.</p>
<h2>Borrow and Invest in crypto</h2>
<p>This is extremely popular with platforms such as <a href="https://aave.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aave</a> where there are almost $20 billion in crypto assets deposited. The method isn’t simple, but it can provide some very high returns. Deposit crypto onto the platform, borrow against your deposit, and then invest that somewhere to get a yield. For example, you can deposit Bitcoin with Aave and earn 2%, you can then borrow 30% of the value of your Bitcoin in a stablecoin asset for which Aave will pay you around 1% (the weird world of crypto sometimes has positive net borrowing rates) some of which will be charged directly and some of which is paid back in their token. You can then deposit the borrowed stablecoin on their platform for yields of up to 10%.</p>
<h2>Borrow and invest in fiat</h2>
<p>This is becoming popular as platforms such as Celsius and Nexo allow you to borrow and withdraw fiat currency against the value of your crypto. Like the previous strategy, however, you borrow in fiat so can invest the money in the ‘real-world’ for whatever return you can find out there. Don’t be surprised if you hear stories of people borrowing against crypto and buying property that generates rental yield in the future.</p>
<h2>Staking</h2>
<p>Staking refers to the process of lodging assets within a smart contract for the purpose of providing liquidity. The most common place to stake assets is with decentralised exchanges where you help support a specific cross. An example would be Uniswap, a decentralised exchange, which will pay you to stake assets to support their customers exchanging Stablecoins. You can lodge either crypto with Uniswap and it will convert your assets into a balanced mix of both coins. This balancing or Automated Market Making (AMM) will continue as customers buy and sell on the platform. Each time a customer buys or sells they pay a trading fee which is shared with those that have supplied liquidity.</p>
<h2>HODL</h2>
<p>Or Hold On for Dear Life. The world of traditional finance has shown us that active retail traders lose money. There is now a requirement from regulators that most brokers have to display the percentage of users who use their service that loses money. The figure is usually above 80%. The same goes for crypto, buying and selling actively will invariably see you buy the top and sell the bottom. Long-term investing can often be the best way if you are buying into solid businesses.</p>
<h2>Earn Interest with AQRU</h2>
<p>Why then aren’t more of us <a href="https://aqru.io/insights/how-to-pay-off-your-mortgage-using-cryptocurrency/">taking advantage of these opportunities to earn money</a> on our crypto? Simply put, it&#8217;s complicated, expensive, time-consuming, and risky for the uninitiated. It is for this reason that AQRU has developed a simple <strong>app that allows you to earn a yield on your crypto assets</strong> or simply deposit fiat currency and convert it into crypto to immediately start earning. All the heavy lifting, rebalancing, and cost are undertaken by AQRU saving you time and money. Yields range from 1% on BTC and ETH up to 15% for EUR and USD pegged assets. Accounts can be set up in minutes, and you can <a href="https://app.aqru.io/register">start earning rewards immediately</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>May 2021 saw a few erratic tweets from Elon Musk and a potential China crypto ban crater crypto assets by 50% in a little over a week. Crypto and social media have always gone hand-in-hand, but it seems prices have become highly sensitive to rumors that fly around the <a href="https://twitter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twittosphere</a>.</p>
<p>Getting accurate information in the world of crypto is difficult. There are millions of self-proclaimed pundits on Twitter and by the time traditional news outlets have picked up on stories they are old news. This means that often false information can get circulated and picked up when it should be ignored.</p>
<p>With that in mind let’s get debunking.</p>
<h2>Myth 1: Bitcoin isn’t bad for the environment.</h2>
<p>According to an International Agency Report, Bitcoin mining accounts for 0.52% of all global energy consumption. This is slightly more than the energy used by the Netherland and slightly less than that used by the UAE. Regardless of how this energy is generated, Bitcoin is a net contributor to global energy consumption and there are less energy-intensive consensus mechanisms out there that could do the same job as Bitcoin if they had the same support it enjoys. The arguments around it replacing an expansionary economic system does not really take into account the world’s growing population or how we will get the billions currently in poverty to a better standard of living. Proof Of Stake is increasingly becoming the go-to consensus mechanism and requires orders of magnitude less energy than Proof of Work.</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/tqtezos/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake-the-ecological-footprint-c58029faee44" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn more about why Bitcoin isn&#8217;t bad for the environment</a></p>
<h2>Myth 2: Cryptocurrencies are just a fad</h2>
<p>What started as a small community of developers and a whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto has blossomed into a trillion-dollar plus market. Real-world use cases for cryptocurrency spanning remittance, insurance, lending, and even property rights are appearing every day. Central banks seeing the popularity of decentralised currencies such as Bitcoin are now exploring Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) as a way of reducing the friction inherent in payments within the traditional world of finance. As their utility in everyday life continues to increase, we should see their popularity and value move in lockstep.</p>
<p><a href="https://builtin.com/blockchain/blockchain-applications" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn more about how cryptocurrencies are staying relevant</a></p>
<h2>Myth 3: Cryptocurrencies can be counterfeit</h2>
<p>One of the major differences between traditional money and cryptocurrency is that you can trace the history of a Bitcoin right back to the moment it was created. The Bitcoin blockchain is an immutable record of all transactions that have occurred within the Bitcoin ecosystem giving it a flawless transaction history. Now compare that to the Dollars or Sterling you might have in your wallet. It is impossible to have the same level of insight into the provenance of traditional currency. This leads us nicely onto our next myth.</p>
<p><a href="https://dzone.com/articles/a-guide-to-blockchain-immutability-and-chief-chall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn more here about blockchain immunity</a></p>
<h2>Myth 4: Cryptocurrencies are only used for money laundering and crime</h2>
<p>As the crypto market grows, one likely casualty is anonymity as regulators begin to take more action. When sending money through the traditional banking system you are required to identify both yourself and the person receiving funds. In crypto this same process is done via anonymised wallets, and it is impossible to establish who owns that wallet. Regulation such as the ‘travel rule’ in the U.S. will mean the same information may be required to do a wallet-to-wallet transfer in the future. Future regulation aside, you only need to look at the blossoming use cases being provided by emerging players in the DeFi space to realise cryptocurrencies are about far more than just crime.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.corporatecomplianceinsights.com/compliance-challenges-crypto-and-the-travel-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn more about why cryptocurrencies are not used for money laundering</a></p>
<h2>Myth 5: Blockchain technology and cryptocurrency are the same</h2>
<p>They are closely related by not the same thing. The blockchain is the technology on which a cryptocurrency is based. There are multiple blockchains and depending on which cryptocurrencies you hold it might be on the Ethereum blockchain or the Bitcoin blockchain or a host of others. Another way of looking at it might be comparing blockchain with the internet and cryptocurrency to Google which uses the internet to operate.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Despite the enormous popularity of cryptocurrency, it is increasingly becoming impenetrable to the everyday investor who has a mountain of <a href="https://aqru.io/insights/is-crypto-jargon-confusing-you/">jargon</a> to decipher to get started. It is to solve this problem that AQRU provides a simple online portal through which to <a href="https://aqru.io/">invest and earn market-leading returns through crypto</a>. You can fund your account in fiat or crypto and begin earning instantly with funds available for withdrawal at any time.</p>
