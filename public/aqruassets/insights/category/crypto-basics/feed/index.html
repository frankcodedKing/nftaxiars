										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Why Invest in Cryptocurrency?</h2>
<p>Have you seen the state of traditional finance lately? Even with interest rate rises, savers still get an insulting rate of interest while inflation ravages the real value of their assets.</p>
<p>At times like this, experienced investors turn to developing markets for better rates of return. But regular people… well, do you fancy investing in the Mexican stock market, or in a Far-East investment fund?</p>
<p>No, I didn’t think so. Only experts and the foolhardy would dare!</p>
<p>Luckily, there’s another developing market on your doorstep that can offer excellent returns: <a href="https://aqru.io/crypto-interest/">Cryptocurrency</a>, which has now achieved a certain respectability in traditional finance. Three years ago they would cancel your bank account for even thinking about sending money to a<br />
Cryptocurrency exchange, and now they just warn you about scammers. This is progress!</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency is high risk though, compared to traditional finance. But there are ways that beginners can at least manage that to acceptable levels.</p>
<p><strong>There are thousands of Cryptocurrencies, and everything but Bitcoin is called an “altcoin”</strong> – an acknowledgement of Bitcoin’s special place in the ecosystem. Altcoins come in all shapes, sizes and Blockchains, but Ethereum aside, they’re generally riskier and more volatile than Bitcoin.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll explore some of <strong>the best Crypto to invest in</strong>. Remember, this is not financial advice and you should always do your own research before investing.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p><a href="https://aqru.io/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> is the big gorilla in the Crypto market. It was also the <strong>first proper Cryptocurrency and is the one with the biggest overall value</strong> (“market cap”). It’s bought and sold everywhere, and as a decentralised system, isn’t under the control of any Government or company.</p>
<p>Traditionally the biggest risk in Bitcoin was that Governments would ban it and kill it. While Governments can still ban their citizens from using it or trading it, the Crypto itself is now effectively untouchable, which reduces the risk it will ever “go to zero”.</p>
<p>The main reason someone would <a href="https://aqru.io/earn-interest-bitcoin/">invest in Bitcoin</a> is simply because they think its value will increase. Historically (over 5-year periods), this has always been true. It’s volatile though: its price often jumps up and down by as much as 10% in a day (5% is quite common). The reason an investor might expect it to go up over time is that there are only 21,000,000 of them that can ever exist, and they’ve found 18,000,000. Since the difficulty goes up all the time, scarcity is introduced. Also, people keep finding more uses for Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Some people call Bitcoin “Digital Gold” because it acts as a store of value.</p>
<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>If people find more uses for Bitcoin quickly, the use of <a href="https://aqru.io/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> has exploded so much that it needs an upgrade!</p>
<p>While Bitcoin was planned as a digital currency, Ethereum was planned as a world computer that could safely process financial information, run computer programs (called “Smart Contracts”) and a lot more besides.</p>
<p>The native currency of the Ethereum Blockchain is “Ether” (ETH for short), and it’s needed to run Smart Contracts. This means anyone using the facilities of the Ethereum Blockchain has to buy ETH, ensuring constant demand. Luckily for investors, it has also <strong>tended to go up in price over the long term</strong> (but it’s also volatile in the short term).</p>
<p>ETH can also be bought anywhere that Bitcoin is sold. These two are the Coke and Pepsi of Crypto.</p>
<p>Ethereum is also undergoing an upgrade at the moment: if that succeeds, and traditional finance jumps into Ethereum 2.0, it could be a wild ride.</p>
<h2>Stablecoins</h2>
<p>If BTC and ETH are the Coke and Pepsi of Crypto, Stablecoins are the sparkling water. They’re designed to track the price of a real-world asset. There are Stablecoins for most currencies. They’re not official central bank currencies, which are called CBDCs – Central Bank Digital Currencies.</p>
<p>Instead, <strong>Stablecoins are run by private companies who use a variety of tricks to make the currencies worth something</strong>.</p>
<p>Where Bitcoin and Ethereum can go up (and down!) against the dollar, US Stablecoins are designed to stay 1:1 with it through a variety of methods best described as “complicated”. They don’t stay exactly 1:1 either, but they’re supposed to correct when they drift off. USDC is “asset-backed” – that is, they have (or claim to have) enough dollar assets locked up to pay for every token they have issued.</p>
<h2>Alternatives</h2>
<p>Of course, there are thousands more Cryptocurrencies and tokens. Some can look very sexy when they’re going up. But many an investor dollar has been lost to the world of altcoins when they start plummeting more than Bitcoin and Ethereum do. Equally, not all Stablecoins are created equal, and some have very dodgy underpinnings that are causing a lot of concern in the Cryptocurrency sector.</p>
<h2>Choose AQRU to Invest your Cryptocurrency</h2>
<p>It’s not entirely by coincidence that AQRU offers interest on your BTC, <a href="https://aqru.io/earn-interest-ethereum/">ETH</a> and US Dollar Stablecoins, but only includes coins that have a good track record. For AQRU, safety is the name of the game (even if with BTC and ETH your asset value is still market-driven).</p>
<p><strong>AQRU’s app and web platform enable you to invest in BTC, ETH and a basket of USD Stablecoins</strong> if you want, which means you can diversify your portfolio and also get 1% interest on them, and up to 7% on your Stablecoins.</p>
<p>Interest calculated daily and reinvested means that you can claim you’re <a href="https://aqru.io/insights/a-beginners-guide-to-yield-farming/">Yield Farming</a> (if anyone asks)!</p>
<p>Fee-free deposit and withdrawal (except for a $20 fee for withdrawals to Cryptocurrency) also help, and you can even buy Crypto in-app with MoonPay, a trusted third-party payment provider (fees apply for Crypto purchases).</p>
<p>Other attractions include a no-strings 10USDC investment so you can see the system in action, referral bonuses of $75 (T&amp;Cs apply of course). The minimum deposit is low at 100 Euros, so you can make regular deposits.</p>
<p>Overall, <strong>AQRU is a good way to have a diversified portfolio of the most mainstream Cryptocurrency</strong> and have it working for you in a tough financial environment. <a href="https://app.aqru.io/register">Sign up for free</a> today to get started!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you like “interest”, but hate “interesting”? Let us tell you about <a href="https://aqru.io/crypto-interest/account/">Crypto interest accounts</a>. They’re Crypto-related, but with none of the drama and intrigue traditionally associated with this cutting-edge financial sector. They’re not technical, they don’t need a series of 1000+ word blog articles to understand, and they’re definitely accessible to everyone.</p>
<h2>How it Works</h2>
<p>It works the same as a deposit account in a bank. You deposit your money (Crypto calls this “staking” because they like dramatic words). Whoever you deposit your money with uses it for various financial activities, and in return gives you a guaranteed percentage return on it.</p>
<h3>What Percentage Returns?</h3>
<p>Unlike traditional banking, there is no central interest rate for companies to base it on. Each company chooses their own interest rate structure. These can get complicated, so it’s best to read the small print.</p>
<p>At AQRU, we don’t do small print and have one of the simplest rate structures, offering <a href="https://aqru.io/earn-interest-bitcoin/">1% on Bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://aqru.io/earn-interest-ethereum/">Ethereum</a> Cryptos, and up to <a href="https://aqru.io/crypto-interest/">7% on US Dollar “Stablecoins”</a> (private digital currencies that track the US dollar). This is our best rate, available to everyone, and applicable to all your deposits.</p>
<p>Some companies that also offer Crypto interest accounts complicate this a bit, maybe to add drama!</p>
<h4>Common barriers are:</h4>
<h5>1. High Minimum Deposits</h5>
<p>AQRU has a minimum deposit of just 100 Euros, but that figure is much higher for some companies, and really stops regular saving.</p>
<h5>2. Tiered Interest Rates</h5>
<p>In traditional finance, it’s expected that the more you deposit, the better the interest rate. Some companies, however, pay inferior rates on higher deposits.</p>
<h5>3. Token-Dependent Rates</h5>
<p>In some cases, a provider will reserve the best rates for depositors who have bought a substantial number of their own tokens and “staked” them (by locking them up). So you must buy another Crypto token to stake yours at the best rate. Obviously, AQRU doesn’t do that.</p>
<h2>How do Crypto Deposit Accounts differ from Traditional Finance ones?</h2>
<p>Consumer deposits in traditional finance are one of the few areas where the Government guarantees the safety of your funds through the <a href="https://www.fscs.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Financial Services Compensation Scheme</a>.</p>
<p>The FSCS says “If you <a href="https://www.fscs.org.uk/what-we-cover/#!/synthetix/article/qed00357" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hold money with a UK-authorised bank</a>, building society or <a href="https://www.fscs.org.uk/what-we-cover/credit-unions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">credit union</a> that fails, we’ll automatically compensate you</p>
<ul>
<li>up to £85,000 per eligible person, per bank, building society or credit union.</li>
<li>up to £170,000 for joint accounts.</li>
</ul>
<p>We protect certain qualifying <a href="https://www.fscs.org.uk/making-a-claim/claims-process/temporary-high-balances/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">temporary high balances</a> up to £1 million for 6 months from when the amount was first deposited.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <strong>such Government largesse doesn’t apply to Crypto investment accounts</strong>. In fact, it also doesn’t apply to most traditional financial activities. The Government’s scheme is intended to protect consumers when they are forced to use a financial service in order to live a normal life. This includes things like mortgages, pensions, insurance companies and funeral services.</p>
<p><strong>The other way a Crypto interest account differs is that the interest/yield rates offered are larger</strong>. The existence of a “bank base rate” means that banks can pay low rates of interest and blame someone else. Which is how they like it.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Crypto Interest Accounts</h2>
<p>We’ve never seen a bank account that shows you the interest you’re earning in real-time on a per-second basis. But, because <strong>Crypto interest accounts have dynamic apps or websites</strong>, you can experience the drama of an ever-increasing wealth level!</p>
<p>But beyond the excitement of shifting numbers lies a number of other benefits with Crypto interest accounts:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Interest rates are better than traditional finance</strong>, of course, and better than inflation.</li>
<li>You can invest in a number of currencies, including different Cryptocurrencies and Stablecoins.</li>
<li>If you’re in love with drama, you can deposit Crypto and still watch the financial charts to see how much it’s worth.</li>
<li>You can feel the warm glow of feeling like your money is working for you, not against you.</li>
<li>They contribute to world peace.</li>
</ol>
<p>OK, that last one might not be true, but if everyone felt that warm glow of financial security… maybe the world would be a better place!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://aqru.io/insights/what-is-yield-farming/">Yield Farming</a> is a lot like real farming.</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s a lot harder than it looks</li>
<li>What you get out of it is unpredictable</li>
<li>While you can get started small, you only make a profit by going large</li>
<li>It involves jumping through a lot of hoops</li>
</ol>
<p>But let’s backtrack on this latest craze: what is it, how does it work, and why could we stay away from it and instead leave our Crypto in one place to earn a guaranteed rate of return which is reinvested every day?</p>
<h2>What is Yield Farming?</h2>
<p>Decentralised Finance (DeFi) reached the point in 2018 where they discovered the concept of interest (called “yield”, because it’s a more fitting term).</p>
<p>The idea is simple: you plant an investment, and it starts growing. <strong>It generates “yield”, which is paid either in the same token, a different token or even a combination of tokens</strong>. It’s common to be paid by a token specific to the provider you use. This token might even give you a say over how the provider operates. The rules and returns are different for each platform of course.</p>
<p>So, your mission is to take those yielded tokens to another platform, plant it there, watch it grow, harvest it, and so on.</p>
<p>True Yield Farming involves regularly ploughing your Crypto fields to unearth new opportunities or review existing ones.</p>
<p>Are you getting the optimum yield? Are you even on the right Blockchain?</p>
<h2>Who’s doing Yield Farming?</h2>
<p>Although Yield Farming has experienced explosive growth, it’s still mainly driven by Crypto enthusiasts and finance people who decided that the wild west area of Crypto was more to their liking. This team is left dreaming up complex and risky financial ideas with no one riding over the hill to set them straight. <strong>The term “high risk, high reward” was created for this environment</strong>.</p>
<p>There isn’t enough regulation in the sector to let banks join in, for instance. And the area is possibly too complex and risky for retail investors who would normally just stick their money in the bank.</p>
<h3>But where do these yields come from?</h3>
<p>With Decentralised Finance came Crypto lending and borrowing platforms (called “protocols”, because new sectors just love to create new jargon).</p>
<p>Obviously, these platforms need Crypto to lend out, and they need to reward people/companies for making Crypto available to their “liquidity pools” or “staking pools”.</p>
<p>These pools of resources allow platforms to function effectively. If a provider/protocol runs out of liquidity, that’s a real problem for them.</p>
<p>So the rewards for staking your Crypto are larger than the rewards you would get from lending your money to a bank (otherwise known as “saving”). And that means high “interest” on each side: lenders get more, and borrowers pay more.</p>
<h3>Why on earth would they do that?</h3>
<p>Well, mostly because the borrowers are convinced they can make a profit elsewhere.</p>
<p>There are thousands of Cryptocurrencies on exchanges and thousands more hiding on other Blockchains. There’s a ton of financial activities, coin launches, mining operations, etc (virtually all unregulated!). These are all potential moneymakers.</p>
<p>That explains why <strong>DeFi companies can offer yields much larger than the traditional finance sector</strong>, and it’s the same reason why <a href="https://aqru.io/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> is so volatile: people keep gambling with Crypto and this volatility can generate startling returns if you get lucky.</p>
<h3>Sounds like I’m on the right side of that equation</h3>
<p>It’s certainly a lot less risky to earn a smaller return by providing liquidity than borrowing money, yes: technically all you have to do is place your Crypto in place (A) to <a href="https://aqru.io/crypto-interest/">earn a return</a> (B), then transfer it to (C) to earn (D).</p>
<p>By far the biggest place you’d do this is <a href="https://uniswap.org/ecosystem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uniswap</a>, the second-biggest decentralised exchange, which hosts a bewildering number of dApps, tools and options. They also have an app themselves.</p>
<p>The Uniswap platform offers swaps between tokens (the exchange bit), and the ability to stake Crypto into liquidity pools for particular tokens: there are thousands of these tokens, generically called “ERC-20” tokens because they correspond to a particular technical standard.</p>
<p>As a liquidity provider, you earn a percentage of trading fees for every swap with that token, and you can earn significant interest, which varies dramatically according to market fluctuations and the token itself.</p>
<p>The people who deposit the most might also get a chance to govern the token rules too (by being given “governance tokens”): and as you’d probably expect, if a few people get a chance to make rules in their favour, they probably will (such as changing the yields).</p>
<h3>So.. some doubts then?</h3>
<p>A whole field of doubts, as you can tell.</p>
<p>1. Liquidity pools offer annual returns, yet some are only open for weeks and can open and close without notice.</p>
<p>One complaint about the behaviour of some liquidity pools is that there’s a lack of transparency about the returns, and liquidity pools come and go with very little scrutiny about their promises. It’s all unregulated, too.</p>
<p>2. Most tokens are small enough to be manipulated by a small number of rich people (“Whales”).</p>
<p>There is a huge difference between the amount of capital a regular person can invest (four figures, five figures if lucky), and the amount available to some of the players in Crypto, some of whom were lucky enough to have already made unimaginable amounts of money. Rich people can use tokens and liquidity pools like their own personal playthings. And guess who comes off worst?</p>
<p>3. ETH gas fees make moving small amounts and token swaps incredibly costly, at least on <a href="https://aqru.io/ethereum/">Ethereum</a>.</p>
<p>This is the biggest reason why <strong>Yield Farming is only really a reasonable thing to do if you have five figures or more to invest</strong>.</p>
<p>Currently, prior to its ETH 2.0 upgrade, fees on the Ethereum Blockchain for doing pretty much anything are very high. Since those fees are more like flat fees, moving tokens around to take advantage of yield can wipe out any gains instantly. When the cost of converting $100 of USD Stablecoins to ETH works out at $33, you know something needs fixing.</p>
<p>4. The yields you’re moving about are much smaller than the amount you invested.</p>
<p><strong>The whole point of Yield Farming is to get a yield in one place and invest it in another</strong>. But the yield you’re moving will be a lot smaller than the amount you invested, especially if you’re not leaving the investment in long. So high gas fees are a problem even if you’ve invested quite a lot.</p>
<h2>Will ETH 2.0 collapse DeFi?</h2>
<p>The ETH 2.0 upgrade should reduce gas fees to a fraction of their current level. But many of the yields in Yield Farming are dependent upon shares of transaction fees. At the moment, these are high. But where will the yield come from when the friction is removed?</p>
<h2>An Alternative to Ethereum</h2>
<p>A glimpse into the future is provided by a Blockchain that “forked” from Ethereum (i.e. it split off and started developing differently). That’s <a href="https://www.bnbchain.world/en/smartChain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance Smart Chain</a>, where ultra-low fees are a reality, yield farms such as “Autofarm” and “Pancake Bunny” still appear to be operating, and Crypto holders are moving around tokens much more than on Ethereum. Unlike Ethereum, the Binance Smart Chain is much less decentralised, which has advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p><em>Advantages</em>: more controlled.</p>
<p><em>Disadvantages</em>: who by?</p>
<p>If you’re determined to yield farm with limited funds, then Binance’s “Smart Wallet” will introduce you to a staggering range of DeFi activities to thrill you and sap your wallet.</p>
<h3>Where is this all going?</h3>
<p>Regulators, in their painfully slow way, are paying closer and closer attention to the activities happening in Cryptocurrency, and that includes Decentralised Finance. While they can’t close up something like Ethereum, they could definitely take a chunk out of Binance Smart Chain if they wanted.</p>
<p>All of this lack of regulation also points to another thing: you have a market worth billions, but <strong>Yield Farming is not something that will ever achieve a critical mass with consumers</strong>: it’s complicated, scary and technical (and always will be).</p>
<p>That means that the potentially trillions of pounds from traditional finance just waiting in the wings are unlikely to pour into DeFi – the rules and the regulators would never allow it. Instead, those trillions will end up in regulator-friendly areas such as Security Tokens, derivatives, or Crypto-driven mutual funds. DeFi will always be a quick, dirty and anonymous alternative to traditional finance and KYC, but as the off-ramps to “real” currency are removed and anonymous exchange accounts are further restricted, doing anything with your theoretical “profits” becomes more and more difficult.</p>
<h2>Bottom Line</h2>
<p>Yield Farming is actually a lot of work and a lot of risk if you’re aiming for optimal return.</p>
<p>This kind of Yield Farming on Ethereum isn’t mathematically even worth doing unless you’ve got a lot to invest because of gas fees that cancel out much of the yield.</p>
<p>Yield Farming on Binance Smart Chain with “Pancake Bunny” would probably give your financial advisor a heart attack once they’d stopped laughing about the name “Pancake Bunny”, and the coins are, if anything, even smaller and more questionable than the ERC-20 tokens you’d find on Uniswap.</p>
<h3>So, how can I farm a yield without Yield Farming?</h3>
<p>For newcomers to Crypto, maybe the best idea for a “set and forget” approach to Crypto is to invest in an <a href="https://aqru.io/crypto-interest/account/">interest-bearing Crypto account</a> that either offers 7% APY on Stablecoins (that track the value of a real-world asset, such as the US Dollar) and 1% on long-established Crypto such as <a href="https://aqru.io/earn-interest-ethereum/">Ethereum</a> and <a href="https://aqru.io/earn-interest-bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>.</p>
<p>AQRU’s platform also offers interest calculated and added per day (though you can see it being added in real-time for fun). <strong>Because that interest is re-invested, this is a very easy source of Yield Farming</strong>: it happens automatically, and there are no extra fees for doing it.</p>
<p>Combine that with a friendly interface, a 10USDC initial welcome investment, KYC and excellent security, no fees for deposits and only a 100 Euro minimum deposit, and this is the sort of Yield Farming that would make even Old McBitcoin happy on his farm. Wait, did we get that right…?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re just starting out on your digital currency journey, it pays to start slow and remember that there’s safety in numbers. <strong>The most popular Cryptocurrencies didn’t get that way by accident</strong>: they got there by being usable and well-supported. While you can make startling returns trading some of the most obscure coins, it’s high-risk and not something for people new to Cryptocurrency.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p><a href="https://aqru.io/earn-interest-bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> wasn’t the first attempt at a digital currency, but it was the first successful one. Created by visionary Nakamoto Satoshi and Hal Finney, it was a response to the financial crisis of 2008: indeed, in the first “block” of Bitcoin’s blockchain, there is a reference from the UK’s “The Times”:</p>
<p>“The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks”</p>
<p>And an entirely new financial network was created that, 13 years later, is still prospering.</p>
<p>But <strong>why is Bitcoin suitable for beginners</strong>?</p>
<p>Basically: it’s everywhere. Everything Cryptocurrency-related supports it, it’s hack-proof, and it’s got a long and distinguished history. Also, people have heard of it (which isn’t true for almost any other Cryptocurrency). This makes it a lot easier to explain to your family what you’re doing!</p>
<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>If Bitcoin is the Coca-Cola in the Cryptocurrency industry, <a href="https://aqru.io/earn-interest-ethereum/">Ethereum</a> is Pepsi. It’s found next to Bitcoin everywhere that Crypto is supported. It’s well-established and safe, although a forthcoming upgrade to Ethereum 2.0 might mean temporary instability.</p>
<p>It’s also more useful than Bitcoin because it’s used to pay transmission fees for sending other Cryptocurrencies around, and forms the bedrock of the NFT network.</p>
<p><strong>Both of these Cryptocurrencies have the same high volatility that most Cryptocurrencies have</strong>: the value against the dollar and other fiat currencies can fluctuate unpredictably. This might mean your investment drops in value, though generally, Cryptocurrencies recover if you wait long enough.</p>
<p>One of the easiest ways to make a return from Cryptocurrency is to use our platform at AQRU to <a href="https://aqru.io/crypto-interest/">deposit your Crypto and earn interest on it</a>: for instance, 1% for Bitcoin and Ethereum. While the value of your investment can go up and down, leaving it within our platform to accumulate generally makes more sense, and you can exit at any time if the price has gone up so much you want to sell. And if you do, you have more Crypto than you started with!</p>
<h2>Stablecoins</h2>
<p>If that sounds too risky, then Stablecoins may be for you. <strong>A Stablecoin is a Cryptocurrency that’s pegged itself to a real-world asset</strong>. For instance, the Cryptocurrency USDC pegs itself to the US Dollar.</p>
<p>Buying a stablecoin makes no sense if you want your investment to increase in value, but it makes sense if you want to earn more digital dollars than you could earn through traditional banking. As an interest-generating platform, we leverage the way Crypto lending works to offer interest rates of up to 7% on stablecoin deposits. You even get 10USDC invested instantly for you when you sign up. Because the minimum deposit is only 100 euros, <strong>it&#8217;s easy for beginners to start</strong>, and you can even buy Crypto from within the app, saving a lot of hassle. To start your Cryptocurrency earning journey, <a href="https://app.aqru.io/register">sign up</a> with AQRU today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Listening to the banks talking about Crypto, you’d think that “staking” was something they’d do to it, to stop it sucking the juice out of their financial system.</p>
<p><strong>“Staking Crypto” is when you agree to commit your Crypto tokens so that you can’t use them anymore without “withdrawing” them</strong>. So, why would you “stake” your tokens? Simple: to <a href="https://aqru.io/crypto-interest/">earn more tokens</a> (basically: interest).</p>
<p>There are two kinds of “crypto staking” to brief you on. While both result in you being marginally richer, they’re achieved in different ways, and your tokens are used for different things. But first… you need to know something simple about blockchains!</p>
<h2>Blockchains made easy</h2>
<p>You’ve probably heard of a “blockchain”.</p>
<p>A blockchain is the backbone behind every Crypto coin. It combines a shared database of transaction blocks (that can’t be edited – that’s quite important!) and an almost infinite number of “addresses” (like little post boxes, or mini bank accounts).</p>
<p>In the non-Crypto financial system, transactions and data storage are done centrally by the bank using its own fantastically expensive equipment inside a very secure environment. Cryptocurrency works by sharing the storage and transaction processing amongst a large number of different computers belonging to other people.</p>
<p>“How can they be trusted?”, you’re probably asking yourself. Well, they can’t. That’s why blockchains are designed not to need “trust”. Every blockchain has a way of adding transactions to the database that involves getting an agreement on what just happened between lots of different computers. This is called “consensus”.</p>
<p>In exchange for processing transactions and keeping the coin working, the blockchain generates new coins to give out for doing it. It can’t reward everyone, so there’s competition for those rewards.</p>
<h3>Proof of Work</h3>
<p>In something like <a href="https://aqru.io/insights/what-is-bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>, that competition is “proof of work”, where computers compete to solve a complex mathematical problem by brute force. Imagine a huge “Battleships” board where the computer chooses a square area, and behind some of them, there’s a Bitcoin. In the early days, the squares you could choose were quite big, so your chances were good. Now, the squares are tiny (and getting tinier!) so it’s much more difficult and requires much more computing (and electricity) to do.</p>
<p>This works great, but it’s a little heavy on the electricity, though the electricity spent does give some fundamental value to the coin.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is the most famous “proof of work” Cryptocurrency. Ethereum is one too, but in its 2.0 version, it’s moving towards a “Proof of Stake” strategy.</p>
<h3>Proof of Stake</h3>
<p>Some Cryptocurrencies adopted another, newer, method called “Proof of Stake”. That’s where <strong>the blockchain essentially runs a lottery to reward people for processing transactions if you “stake” your coins</strong>: i.e. remove them from circulation by essentially freezing them. The winners in the lottery are rewarded based on the amount staked, the time the coins have been there, and a large dose of luck.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you cheat in “Proof of Stake” and it finds you out: your tokens get eaten (a “slashing” event).</p>
<p>Reputable proof of stake Cryptocurrencies include <a href="https://aqru.io/earn-interest-ethereum/">Ethereum</a> 2.0, Polkadot, Cardano, Tezos and Algorand. There are a lot more, some of which are scams: not that it’s obvious!</p>
<p>In both systems, it’s unlikely that any small coin holder will be lucky enough for this award, which is why “pools” exist, which gather the processing power or coins of large numbers of people together to combine their resources and share the rewards.</p>
<p>Functionally, what happens if you join a pool is that <strong>you commit your Crypto and get rewarded by a small amount every so often – like interest</strong> (but less regular and not guaranteed).</p>
<h2>Staking for interest</h2>
<p>Many Cryptocurrency owners stake their currency for something that looks a bit like “interest”.</p>
<p>Some decide that they’d rather cut out the technical bit and “stake” their coins with companies paying regular and predictable interest (sometimes per-second, which is some great compound interest potential!).</p>
<p>This means changing what you trust: blockchain staking means trusting in the technical system behind Cryptocurrency and the people who created the coin. <strong>Interest staking means trusting in a particular company to use your coins wisely and keep their promises</strong>.</p>
<p>But, with a reputable company, how does interest staking compare with blockchain staking?</p>
<ol>
<li>You can invest in a basket of Cryptocurrencies, including some that are “proof of work” like <a href="https://aqru.io/earn-interest-bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>, and you can also invest in “stablecoins”, which are less volatile and a better choice for beginners.</li>
<li><strong>The interest you earn is predictable and stable</strong>. With a company like AQRU, we pay interest daily and track it to the second.</li>
<li>The technical stuff is handled by someone else who knows their stuff, and all you have to do is to watch your investment grow.</li>
<li>Depending on the company, there’s less lock-in for your Crypto.</li>
<li>There are regulators looking on (though your deposits aren’t protected by Government schemes like FDIC).</li>
</ol>
<p>How do the companies use your coins behind the scenes to make your interest? By participating in liquidity schemes, and by lending to businesses that are willing to pay extra interest rates to borrow assets inside the Crypto ecosystem. Generally, there’s a basket of decentralised finance activities they’re qualified to do (and experts in). It’s not a world apart from an investment fund, except in a less mature (and more lucrative) market.</p>
<p>So, how do you benefit from staking? Well, assuming that blockchain staking is a bit technical, <strong>the best way to get going with interest staking is to get started with us, at AQRU</strong>! We are a leading provider and it’s free to <a href="https://app.aqru.io/register">sign up</a> on our app or website. We even invest 10USDC for you for free when you sign up so you can see the per-second wealth display. It can be funded with debit cards (minimum amount of 100 Euros), and the only fee involved is $20 to withdraw in Crypto (fiat withdrawals are free). You can buy Crypto in the app through our trusted provider <a href="https://www.moonpay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MoonPay</a>, though (as with all Crypto purchases) transaction fees apply. Buying in the app is good because you avoid the withdrawal and transfer fees charged when you try to buy Cryptocurrency elsewhere, like an exchange.</p>
<p>AQRU pays a fixed annual percentage yield of 1% on Crypto and up to 7% on stablecoins and doesn’t tie up your Crypto.</p>
<p>But, as always, due diligence is your friend! There’s a lot at stake!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, your interest in Cryptocurrency has turned into an interest in how to make <a href="https://aqru.io/crypto-interest/">interest on Crypto</a>! Interesting!</p>
<p>Some of the Cryptocurrency-acquisition methods here don’t strictly fall under “interest”, but I’m sure you won’t mind that!</p>
<p>Since you’re an owner or owner-to-be of Cryptocurrency, we’ll assume you know what they are and skip straight to the good bit: using your tokens to make more tokens. If not, you can read up on <a href="https://aqru.io/insights/what-is-cryptocurrency/">what is cryptocurrency</a> here.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at some different ways you can <strong>earn more from Crypto</strong>.</p>
<h2>Mining</h2>
<p>Snow White isn’t the only one who can benefit from mining. But what is Crypto mining? And is it a good idea?</p>
<p>Mining is how some Cryptocurrencies (but not all) mint new coins onto their blockchain. It’s called mining because while you’re solving a complex mathematical problem in one, and hitting a rock with an axe in the other, in both cases you’re picking a spot, digging, and seeing if you can find a treasure.</p>
<p>The process of mining for a Cryptocurrency is connected to the process of validating transactions: one is a reward for the other. Central banks pay for very expensive servers and software to keep their systems running.</p>
<p>Crypto, such as <a href="https://aqru.io/earn-interest-bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>, needs lots of computing power around the world to keep validating transactions: transaction fees and Bitcoin mining are the rewards that people get for lending their computing power and electricity to the Bitcoin ecosystem. In fact, there are a huge number of people competing to be the first to solve puzzles and claim the Bitcoin. That’s how you design a system that functions by using computers worldwide but doesn’t trust them.</p>
<p>But how do you make money out of it? Well, it’s become much too difficult for one person with one machine to find a Bitcoin. It’s newsworthy when it happens. And it’s expensive now to buy the equipment to run the calculations (which must be replaced after a while because the difficulty of finding a Bitcoin goes up).</p>
<p>The answer is to sign up for a cloud mining company such as <a href="https://shamining.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shamining</a> that allows you to rent computing power from them and use it to mine. They might join pools of other miners for you, all looking for Bitcoins together, and sharing any they find. The more computing power (“hash power”) you have, the greater your share. Some cloud mining companies offer as much as 40% “profit”. Beware though: it’s completely unregulated and doesn’t pretend to be: they take your money, and provide some power. If they close tomorrow, well, c’est la vie.</p>
<p>However, unlike some of the other options, you never get back your initial investment so you’re vulnerable if the company closes or just quits. You also just have to <strong>hope that they discover enough Bitcoin for you that you can make a profit selling it</strong>: and you don’t know the future price of Bitcoin, nor how difficult it is to mine. Financial “income calculators” on the mining sites are often inaccurate over time, wildly overstating profitability.</p>
<p>Minimum investments tend to be in the $500-$1000 area, and withdrawals tend to be restricted until you earn a certain amount of Bitcoin, to avoid transmission fees eating the whole amount.</p>
<p>While any Cryptocurrency that uses “proof of work” to operate is mineable, there are far fewer than can be done from a cloud environment.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s nothing stopping you (for any coin) from setting up a device and downloading mining software. Just don’t expect miracles &#8211; there are no coins easy to mine that are worth anything.</p>
<p>But do expect overheating equipment since the miner has to be running 24/7.</p>
<h2>Staking</h2>
<p>There are really two kinds of staking. <b>Blockchain staking</b> is when you take your own coins out of circulation and the coin itself rewards you for it with extra tokens or other privileges. Why is this good for the coin? It reduces supply (and increases demand) and stops you from selling them!</p>
<p><b>Interest staking</b> is when you <strong>lodge your coins with a financial provider and they use them to make money and give you an agreed payout</strong>. That is equivalent to interest, but it’s called “<a href="https://aqru.io/yield-as-a-service/">yield</a>” in Crypto-land, so you get an APY (Annual Percentage Yield).</p>
<p>This approach is more flexible than blockchain staking because you can have a portfolio of different Cryptos that you’re earning on, to balance risk. Crypto tokens are legendarily volatile, and while values tend to increase in the long-term, the short- and medium-term movements can be alarming if you’re not used to them. Though don’t forget that it’s not a loss or a gain until you sell!</p>
<p>If you want to mitigate the risk of your coins changing in value against the dollar, you can also earn a yield on stablecoins in this scenario. Stablecoins are Crypto tokens that are pegged to the value of a real-world asset, such as US Dollars. Earning interest on stablecoins is impossible by blockchain staking, but at ARQU, you can <a href="https://aqru.io/earn-interest-usdc/">earn up to 7% APY</a> on them (and 1% for Crypto). This is substantially more than traditional finance offers.</p>
<h2>Airdrops</h2>
<p>Just occasionally, a coin will give airdrops to its token-holders. <strong>An airdrop is when they simply give you free tokens</strong>. This sometimes happens when a token is launched, and can also be triggered by other technical or promotional activities. In general, these aren’t worth much and it’s difficult to track them down. Some of the airdrops occur on obscure tokens that newcomers should be wary of. But, it’s a thing that happens.</p>
<h2>Lending</h2>
<p>When they say decentralised finance allows you to become your own bank, they really weren’t kidding. For instance, you can <strong>lend your Crypto to someone else in a P2P system (“Person to Person”) and charge how much interest you want</strong>, competing with other lenders.</p>
<p>But is it good to be your own bank? One of the reasons banks (and providers such as AQRU) exist is to help protect consumers from that complexity and risk. P2P lending is undoubtedly profitable for some, but it’s fraught with risk.</p>
<h2>Earn Interest with AQRU</h2>
<p>Remember we mentioned interest lending? We covered the risks involved with the various forms of interest gathering, and if you invest with the right company, it’s the safest approach to making the most of your Crypto.</p>
<p>If you want to test that out for free and also earn a complimentary $10 of USDC stablecoin invested for you immediately, you can download the AQRU app, or sign up via our website.</p>
<p>Once the free stablecoins are invested, you’ll be able to see the total asset value going up, per second (and interest is calculated per day).</p>
<p>If you like what you see, then you can go through the verification process and make a deposit. We carry out KYC (“Know Your Customer”) and AML (“Anti-money laundering”) checks, which generally requires a photo ID, and a utility bill. Distrust any company that doesn’t ask you for this!</p>
<p>The minimum deposit is 100 Euros, but you can deposit as much as you like. There are no deposit fees.</p>
<p>If you want to invest in Crypto such as Bitcoin and <a href="https://aqru.io/earn-interest-ethereum/">Ethereum</a>, then you can buy Crypto within the AQRU app using our supported payment provider <a href="https://www.moonpay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MoonPay</a> (transactions fees will apply, but the money gets transferred easily and directly into your AQRU wallet. You can send in Crypto from your own wallet or an exchange too).</p>
<p>The only fee is a withdrawal of $20 if you withdraw to Crypto, but withdrawal to regular “fiat” currency is free.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for, don’t miss out! <a href="https://app.aqru.io/register">Sign up</a> for free today and <strong>start earning interest on your Crypto</strong>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re searching for ways to top up your savings, earn some extra money or plan for the future, you should consider <strong>setting up a Crypto interest account</strong>. In doing so, you’ll access much higher returns than traditional finance and can even earn a passive income from your Cryptocurrency holdings.</p>
<p>This post will discuss some of the benefits of a <a href="https://aqru.io/crypto-interest/account/">crypto interest account</a> and walk you through how to get set up. So, if you&#8217;re ready to start making your money work for you, keep reading!</p>
<h2>Why Set Up a Crypto Interest Account?</h2>
<p>You are missing out on a great opportunity to make your finances work harder for you. Here are some reasons for investing:</p>
<h3>1. Higher Rates of Interest</h3>
<p>When it comes to earning interest on your savings, traditional bank accounts often don&#8217;t provide the best interest rates. In fact, many of them offer returns that are well below 1%. This is where Crypto interest accounts come in. <strong>These accounts provide much higher gains on your investment</strong>. So, if you&#8217;re looking for a quick way to earn more on your money, this is definitely something to consider.</p>
<h3>2. Earn a Passive Income</h3>
<p>A passive income is one that you earn without active participation. <strong>A Crypto interest account is a great way to make a passive income</strong>. By simply holding Cryptocurrency, you can earn reliable interest on your account balance. And because the interest is automatically paid back into your account, it can compound over time to provide a nice boost to your earnings.</p>
<h3>3. Withdraw 24/7</h3>
<p>As anyone who has ever dealt with a traditional bank can attest, one of the most frustrating things is being unable to access your own money when you need it most. Hidden fees or unexpected withdrawal limits can really put a damper on your day. With a Crypto interest account, this is not something you have to concern yourself with. You can access and withdraw your funds at any time without worrying about restrictions or complex terms. So you&#8217;ll always have access to your money when you need it, giving you the reassurance that comes with knowing your finances are under your control.</p>
<h3>4. Diversify Your Portfolio</h3>
<p>When it comes to investing, one of the most important things you can do is diversify your portfolio. You should invest in a variety of different assets so that if one investment loses value, another may still be profitable.</p>
<p>A Crypto interest account can be a great addition to any portfolio. It provides a steady stream of income that can help mitigate the risks associated with other investments. By diversifying your portfolio with a Crypto interest account, you can help reduce overall risks while still benefiting from the potential growth of Cryptocurrencies.</p>
<h2>Which Crypto Assets Can I Earn Interest on?</h2>
<p>Cryptocurrencies have experienced a surge in popularity in recent years as more investors seek to expand their portfolios and take advantage of the promising high returns. Among the most popular Cryptocurrencies are <a href="https://aqru.io/earn-interest-bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> (BTC), <a href="https://aqru.io/earn-interest-ethereum/">Ethereum</a> (ETH) and stablecoins such as <a href="https://aqru.io/earn-interest-usdc/">USDC</a>. Each of these Cryptocurrencies has unique features that make them attractive to investors.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is the most well-known Cryptocurrency, and it has seen significant price growth in recent years. Ether is the second-largest Cryptocurrency by market cap and is often used to power Decentralised Applications (DApps) on the Ethereum network. Finally, stablecoins provide stability by pegging their value to traditional assets like the US dollar or gold. <strong>Investors can stand to profit from all of these Cryptocurrencies with a Crypto interest account</strong>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, it’s a currency that’s pretty damn Crypto.</p>
<p>The End.</p>
<p>OK, there’s a bit more to it than that!</p>
<p>But yes, Cryptocurrency is technical underneath. But it’s like a car: you don’t really need to understand how the engine works to drive it. All you need is the rules of the road, and know how to get in and out of it. Plus, you need an idea of what you actually want to achieve with it, otherwise, it’s just you in a metal box making vroom noises.</p>
<h2>It’s alternative finance</h2>
<p><strong>The Cryptocurrency ecosystem is an alternative financial system that’s not owned by any Government</strong>.</p>
<p>It was set up by technical visionaries to provide an alternative to the regular financial system, following the crash of 2008.</p>
<p>That crash was largely down to banks making irresponsible property loans and then selling that debt to each other. The more that debt got sold, the safer it appeared. Until the debts started to become worthless and the whole house came crashing down. Governments all over the world then printed a lot of money to rescue the banks from their own mess. Of course, regular citizens didn’t see any of this generosity.</p>
<p>Visionaries such as <a href="https://aqru.io/insights/what-is-bitcoin/">man-of-mystery Satoshi</a>, were horrified. They envisaged a financial system for the world that was free of Government control and censorship. They saw a future where every transaction was transparent and traceable, corruption was impossible, and no one could just “print money”.</p>
<p>Bitcoin was the result, and many other Cryptocurrencies followed.</p>
<h2>Is Crypto any use?</h2>
<p><strong>Cryptocurrency is best thought of as “intelligent money”</strong>, and it helps to use the word “tokens” rather than “money” or “coins”.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency can function as a currency allowing you to buy and sell things. But it’s a lot more. Crypto can be smart, too.</p>
<h2>Clever money</h2>
<p>The next big coin to be launched was Ethereum, launched in 2014. Compared to the Gorilla that is Bitcoin, Ethereum is the over-clever chimp from the cartoon with a screwdriver and a box of tricks.</p>
<p>Yes, Ethereum can be transferred to pay for things just like Bitcoin, but its “blockchain” is designed to be used by other tokens, allowing thousands of different tokens to exist.</p>
<p>It also pioneered the idea of “Smart Contracts”: which are bits of code that can intelligently handle transactions. Imagine, in the future, a house purchase done through smart contracts for nothing! Cryptocurrency is the ultimate middleman-remover.</p>
<h2>What is a Blockchain?</h2>
<p>This is the technical bit. <strong>A blockchain is an ever-growing database of transactions that have happened since the birth of the token</strong>. It can’t be edited: that would invalidate transactions and be a very bad idea.</p>
<p>There are lots of copies of that database held on computers around the world, and the blockchain’s job is to make sure they all agree on what happened. The blockchain also has to manage the creation, distribution and sometimes destruction of coins and tokens.</p>
<p>This differs from blockchain to blockchain.</p>
<p>A blockchain would be nothing without “addresses”. They’re like little digital post boxes that can hold tokens: a mini-bank account. An Ethereum address can hold many types of token, from the serious to the comic. Don’t even try to keep up! There are other blockchains that compete with Ethereum on functionality, speed and security, but Ethereum is the one that gained critical mass.</p>
<h2>Why so many tokens?</h2>
<p>Because they have different uses.</p>
<p>Here are the different kinds of tokens you might see out and about:</p>
<ol>
<li>Decentralised store of value – the token exists to be worth something (for example Bitcoin) and isn’t controlled by any central authority</li>
<li>Stablecoins – the token exists to digitally represent the value of something else (like a real-world currency, for instance, such as USDC)</li>
<li>Utility tokens – this specialised token exists to make a system work (for instance, money transfer or supply chain verification)</li>
<li>Security tokens – the token entitles you to a share of an asset (such as a business, a property, or an asset such as art).</li>
</ol>
<h2>Why are these imaginary tokens worth anything?</h2>
<p>Different tokens get their worth in different ways.</p>
<p>For most tokens, there’s a limited maximum amount that can exist: for Bitcoin, it’s 21 million. Other coins have much higher numbers than that. That scarcity is one key to their value. Bitcoin also gets harder to create as time goes on. This also adds to the value. But it’s more than scarcity.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is an example of “proof of work”. The “work” here is solving complex mathematical puzzles by brute force calculation (and trying to be the first to solve the puzzle).</p>
<p>That requires a lot of electricity (most of which is from renewable sources). Some of Bitcoin’s value is the conversion of valuable electricity to Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Some tokens are “Proof of stake”. Coins are earned by “validators” using their computer power to validate transactions on the blockchain.</p>
<p>Utility tokens are often an example of “something is worth whatever someone else is willing to pay”. General investors should probably stay well away!</p>
<p>Security tokens get their worth by providing a share of an underlying asset or revenue flow, and to be considered as ‘security tokens’, they would have to be approved by regulators.</p>
<h2>How do you get Cryptocurrency?</h2>
<p>The only practical way for normal people to get into Cryptocurrency is to buy it, or <a href="https://aqru.io/crypto-interest/">earn it</a>.</p>
<p>You can buy Crypto in many places, and most of the reputable options now take debit cards. Bank transfers are often also possible.</p>
<p>Wherever you buy your Crypto from, you need to make sure that the company is safe and secure. A good company will explain how it deals with these issues on its website. A good company will always let you sign up for free, and then verify your identity. This is called “KYC” (Know Your Customer”), and it’s a sign that the exchange takes its AML (“Anti-money laundering”) obligations seriously.</p>
<p>So, here are some of the options for you to fill your boots:</p>
<h3>Crypto exchange</h3>
<p>A Crypto exchange will bombard you with information.</p>
<p>There are charts, order books, curves of all descriptions and a fast-moving price. This is because it’s geared to traders, who buy and sell Cryptocurrency regularly.</p>
<p>Once they’ve moved their funds into the exchange, they trade between Bitcoin and many other Cryptocurrencies or sell their Cryptocurrency into stablecoins to wait for a good time to rebuy.</p>
<p>While there is a very long list of possible Cryptocurrencies you could buy, you might want to consider Bitcoin: the granddaddy of Cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Exchanges vary wildly in terms of how competitive their rates are, and what fees they charge. While you might get a much better price on the coin, you might face steep commission or fees on withdrawing from the exchange.</p>
<p>The cheapest exchange is <a href="https://digital.inx.co/20-to-trade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">INX Digital</a>. The most popular one with American consumers is Coinbase, but it’s expensive.</p>
<p>Note that some exchanges can’t operate legally in some countries, so you’d need to check.</p>
<p>Other exchanges include Gemini, Kraken and Bitstamp. Regional exchanges also specialise in trades in another native currency, such as <a href="https://www.coincorner.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CoinCorner</a> in the UK. In general, the bigger and more regulated the exchange, the better.</p>
<h3>Paypal or eToro</h3>
<p>eToro and Paypal are organisations both best known for doing something else: in Paypal’s case, providing payment services, and in eToro’s case, an alternative way of buying shares in companies such as Apple or Amazon.</p>
<p>While they are definitely easy and safe to use, neither is cheap.</p>
<h3>Wallet purchases</h3>
<p>When you buy Cryptocurrency at an exchange or Paypal/eToro, your tokens will stay in their custody until you send it somewhere else, usually either a wallet (if you want to store your Crypto) or a lending app (if you want to invest it for interest).</p>
<h2>Storing your stash</h2>
<p>A blockchain consists of a practically inexhaustible supply of addresses. Each one is a bit like a safety deposit box for Crypto tokens. It’s very important to note that <strong>tokens never leave the digital realm: they’re purely virtual</strong>.</p>
<p>However, while the blockchain never loses tokens, it is possible for the owner to lose access to them.</p>
<p>Imagine a safety deposit box with a thin slot on the front that allows tokens to be inserted, and a locked door at the back, to which only you have the key.</p>
<p>The “address” of the box is public: it allows anyone to find the slot and insert coins. However, the key is private to you, and owning it means owning the box and the beautiful, beautiful Crypto inside.</p>
<p>If you lose that key, you can only stand on the outside looking through the slot and dreaming of better times.</p>
<p>If you buy Crypto at an exchange, then you’ve basically bought an IOU. However, exchanges allow you to send your Crypto out of the exchange (for a fee, of course!) to an address you have the key to. At that point, the Crypto is under your control. <strong>You should never leave Crypto at an exchange longer than it’s needed</strong>.</p>
<h2>The Why of Wallets</h2>
<p><strong>A Crypto wallet’s job is to manage a collection of private keys and addresses</strong>, and allow you to send and receive tokens easily.</p>
<p>There are various types of <a href="https://aqru.io/insights/crypto-wallets-explained/">Crypto wallets</a>, and the one that is suitable depends on how secure you want to be: if a wallet is connected to the Internet (for example, an app), it’s less secure than one that isn’t (for example, a USB stick from someone like Trezor or Ledger, or even on a piece of paper).</p>
<p>There’s no actual rule that you only have to use one type, either. If you have a list of the private keys (a wallet should be able to give them to you), then you can create multiple wallets.</p>
<h3>What if my wallet fails?</h3>
<p>Whatever wallet you set up, you will be asked to write down a series of random words. These act as a recovery key for the wallet, and you will only ever see them once. If your phone breaks, or your computer crashes, you can recover your wallet with that phrase.</p>
<ul>
<li>IMPORTANT: that code is specific to that wallet software. While you can give private keys to other wallet software, you cannot get one wallet app to recognise the code from another one.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What do I get out of Crypto?</h2>
<p>Ah, you’re a realist! Yes, <strong>the main reason most people get into Cryptocurrency is to try and make some money</strong>. And that’s just what you can do!</p>
<p>It’s probably best to adjust your expectations: this is a more mature market and “Invest $1, get $1,000,000” doesn’t happen now.</p>
<p>These days a decent return on your money needs what it always did: a nice pot to start, sensible decisions, trusted investment partners, and of course, time.</p>
<p>For those new to Crypto who don’t fancy spending all day trading, the investment choices boil down to two things: what to buy, and what to do with it.</p>
<p><a href="https://aqru.io/insights/crypto-investment-strategies/">Investing in Crypto</a> is, by its nature, not “conservative”. But there are degrees of risk. Let’s assume for a moment that your preferred measure of wealth is US Dollars.</p>
<p>In Crypto, the conservative option is to buy stablecoins.</p>
<p>The price of a stablecoin remains stable, so a US Dollar stablecoin is always worth $1 (more or less).</p>
<p>However, the dollar still moves relative to Bitcoin, other Crypto, and other foreign currencies, and so it can be used as a base for trading in those.</p>
<p>A more aggressive option is to buy an established Crypto such as Bitcoin or <a href="https://aqru.io/earn-interest-ethereum/">Ethereum</a>. The underlying price against the dollar can vary a lot even from hour to hour, and there might be times when the dollar value is less than you paid. However, it’s only a loss when you sell, and <strong>Cryptocurrency has tended to go up over time: if you have patience</strong>.</p>
<p>The ultimate aggressive investment is to buy other Cryptos, known as “altcoins”. There are established altcoins such as Litecoin that everyone agrees are reasonably safe, but it’s highly speculative. The coins in regulated exchanges have generally been vetted and approved.</p>
<h2>Got some Crypto tokens, what now?</h2>
<p>You’re now a proud Crypto owner! So what do you do with it? It’s making no money for you sitting in a wallet.</p>
<p>Luckily, AQRU will give you substantial <a href="http://aqru.io">interest on your tokens</a> if you invest with us. In fact, that’s the only way to make a consistent profit on stablecoins, and it’s certainly a bonus while you’re sitting there waiting for your Crypto to appreciate.</p>
<p>At AQRU, we offer 1% interest on <a href="https://aqru.io/earn-interest-bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> or Ethereum, and up to 7% on dollar stablecoins. You can even buy in the app, and get 10USDC to start. Subject to terms and conditions, we also give you $75 for referrals.</p>
<p>Don’t miss out, sign up today and start earning high rates of interest!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New to Cryptocurrency? Bring yourself up to speed with our super-friendly guide to the virtual world of Crypto-finance.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency is new and exciting. Everyone’s heard of <a href="https://aqru.io/insights/what-is-bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> now, and it’s an <strong>exciting investment opportunity</strong> for the future. Digital currencies are looking like the future, and even Governments can’t wait to get in on the action.</p>
<p>But hold your horses, and manage your expectations of life-changing profits from a £1 investment, and let’s look at what Cryptocurrency actually is and how you can benefit.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency is a digital currency. It doesn’t exist except as a number in a database and you can’t put it in your pocket. There are various types of “coin” (we’ll use the word “token” from now on) and some coins, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, are well established with high liquidity.</p>
<p>There are so-called “stablecoins” that shadow the price of a real-world asset such as a currency or resource (for instance, the US Dollar or the price of Gold).</p>
<p>Then, there are thousands of “altcoins”, which is basically a big basket of “not Bitcoin”. It’s probably for experts only. Don’t worry about these for now.</p>
<p>Finally, there are security tokens: digital stocks and shares representing regulated, actual ownership of an asset or resource. It’s a very new market, but might be worth exploring.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency is a young but maturing market. This means <strong>there are investment opportunities here that traditional markets just don’t offer</strong>.</p>
<p>So, you want to take advantage? The big questions are: How? Where? Why? With who? and we’re here to answer all of them.</p>
<h2>Why invest in Cryptocurrency, specifically?</h2>
<p>Simple: <strong>you get better returns in Crypto than in regular currencies</strong> (which are called “Fiat”). While Crypto is a fascinating subject, you’re probably here because you simply want to make your money work harder.</p>
<p>Well, in Crypto it works harder. The question is: how hard do you want to work?</p>
<h2>Why do Crypto markets generate bigger yields than regular markets?</h2>
<p>Whether it’s company shares, currencies or commodities such as oil, gas or Frozen Concentrated Orange Juice, the whole system is built on financial institutions making large bets on things changing in price.</p>
<p>In traditional financial markets, even though things change rapidly, they don’t generally change by a huge amount at a time. This is partially because the markets are full of automated, high-frequency trading bots written by different companies. These balance each other out in a bit of an arms race. This is called “low volatility”. There’s a lower risk of losing your shirt, but a lower return too.</p>
<h3>Crypto markets move faster, and they swing wider.</h3>
<p>With Crypto, the result is more profit, but also more risk: wins are bigger, losses are bigger. And, as a developing marketplace, bots are less advanced, and the market is affected more by huge trades. Profits/losses of 20% (or even more) in a day for traders are common across a wide range of assets.</p>
<p>How do you take advantage of all this promise? This is where we get to the strategy part.</p>
<h2>Investment Strategies</h2>
<h3>Strategy 1: the thrill of the pump, the agony of the dump</h3>
<h4>Investor type: ACTIVE-AGGRESSIVE, Intervention: intensive trading</h4>
<p>Trading directly on an exchange for profit against fellow traders is very risky. You’re aggressively chasing high profits and taking risks with your assets with no safety net.</p>
<p><strong>This is an “active” investment because it requires attention and action from you</strong>. High-risk, high-reward.</p>
<p>PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE &#8211; Some investors don’t really enjoy being punished on every trade they do, so they let a bot do it and get stressed by that instead. The bot will buy and sell various Cryptocurrencies at the same time to make small profits that add up. In theory. The problem with that is that bots generally work on trading algorithms developed on the mature regular markets: not on these easily-influenced, volatile ones.</p>
<p>The lowest-fee exchange is newcomer <a href="https://www.inx.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">INX</a>, though it doesn’t have a mobile app at time of writing. Other popular exchanges include Gemini and Coinbase.</p>
<h4>Do I have to buy Crypto at an exchange?</h4>
<p>While exchanges often offer the best prices to buy Crypto for investment generally, there are often other options built into the various wallet or investment apps. At AQRU, we have partnered with <a href="https://www.moonpay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MoonPay</a> so you can buy Cryptocurrency directly within a wallet or investment app.</p>
<p>Buying Crypto directly in an app can save money on transmission fees and withdrawal fees, and it goes straight to your portfolio/app/wallet without messing around with addresses.</p>
<h3>Strategy 2: Buy, HODL, profit</h3>
<h4>Investor type: PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE, Intervention: check on the price every so often</h4>
<p><strong>Investment strategy 2 involves buying a Cryptocurrency and holding onto it</strong> (called “HODLing”), hoping it will go up in value.</p>
<p>Historically, it’s been true so far that if you buy Crypto, at some point it will have made you a profit (usually over a period of years rather than months), though if you buy at a peak and it takes a year to get back there, it doesn’t feel like it.</p>
<p>Two approaches to buying Crypto for this purpose are:</p>
<ol>
<li>buying it all at once, and</li>
<li>buying it in small quantities over time so that the cost changes are averaged out (called “Discount Cost Averaging”).</li>
</ol>
<p>Some exchanges and wallets offer “recurring buys” of Crypto for people.</p>
<p>In this strategy, its success or failure depends on changes in the underlying value of the asset, but in the intervening time, that money isn’t working for you, so you can combine strategy 2 with strategy 3!</p>
<h3>Strategy 3: Crypto HODLing &#8211; with interest</h3>
<h4>Investor type: PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE, Intervention: check on the price every so often</h4>
<p>OK, so you’ve bought a nice, established Crypto like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Now you’re waiting to make enough profit to sell: but a new development helps you make your tokens work harder: <a href="http://aqru.io">interest-bearing Crypto savings accounts</a>.</p>
<p>Accounts like this that you’d trust are pretty new, and are possible because of the advent of better regulation, advanced “Know Your Customer” money laundering protection and a more stable Crypto infrastructure.</p>
<p>So, how much can you get? It varies from provider to provider, but it’s vastly more than banks offer.</p>
<p>With today’s high inflation and low-interest rates, savers in the traditional banking system are getting hammered, and the currency decreases in value each year.</p>
<p>But in Crypto, interest rates are much higher, with providers such as AQRU offering interest rates far higher than banks if you park your Crypto with us (or buy it in-app).</p>
<p>What makes this strategy aggressive? Well, you’re still relying on the underlying asset going up in price. Because of the volatility of Cryptocurrency, this is always going to be a risk (or indeed, a reward).</p>
<h3>Strategy 4: Stablecoin Crypto HODLing with interest</h3>
<h4>Investor type: PASSIVE CONSERVATIVE, Intervention: none needed</h4>
<p>Let me introduce you to Stablecoins.</p>
<p>They’re Cryptocurrencies whose technology allows them to follow and reflect the value of another asset. For instance, <a href="https://aqru.io/earn-interest-usdc/">USDC</a> (as you’d expect) mirrors the price of the US Dollar.</p>
<p>Stablecoins came about because Cryptocurrency and foreign exchange markets simply don’t talk to each other, yet exchanges needed something to represent the fiat currencies so trades could be made.</p>
<p>What makes them worth anything at all is that the company behind the coins would be holding assets theoretically equivalent to the value of the issued coins. So in theory, if every holder cashed in, there would be enough money to pay them.</p>
<p>In practice, that never happens because stablecoins are just swapped for other things.</p>
<p>Of course, as you’d expect from the name, the value of a stablecoin remains stable, at least against the underlying asset’s value. If you care about a coin’s value against the US Dollar, then buying a stablecoin means it won’t go up or down in value.</p>
<p>This means that, unlike a Crypto, you’d never buy a stablecoin expecting to make a profit. There are also stablecoins for the Euro, the British Pound and the Yen. Countries around the world are also looking into launching CDBCs (basically: stablecoins issued by a Central Bank, and so a LOT more official than the ones so far). China’s Digital Yuan is the biggest launch so far, but expect it to catch on!</p>
<p>However, it can make you money. Remember the Crypto savings accounts we were mentioning? They give interest on stablecoins too. For instance, at AQRU, we give an unconditional 7% on the USDC Maple token.</p>
<p>How can a real dollar/pound generate insulting returns in the regular markets while a digital one can offer 20-30 times more?</p>
<p>The answer is we are not only looking after tokens from our customers and paying interest: we’re lending it out in various ways at a profit. Companies operating in the Crypto space want stablecoins for the same reason you might want them: they’re linked to a real currency and they want to avoid ups and downs in the real-world value of their investment.</p>
<p>But because there are far fewer reputable options to borrow substantial amounts of Crypto dollars, the interest rate charged to borrowers can be more than they might pay banks in the regular financial system.</p>
<h3>Strategy 5: Security Tokens</h3>
<h4>Investor profile: MODERATE, Intervention: measured</h4>
<p>This is a “one-to-watch”, and under most radars, because it’s an even newer market than Cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>It’s basically <strong>“digital stocks and shares”, with a company or project issuing tokens in exchange for investment</strong>. Different projects offer different rewards (including dividends, but other things as well, like discounts), and there is an underlying asset that the tokens represent a share in: its proper ownership. You would expect to be rewarded for owning the tokens, and you would hope they would also go up in value.</p>
<p>The advantages of a digital security exchange over a stock market are that:</p>
<ol>
<li>retail investors can directly buy</li>
<li>you can buy fractions of a token (you can’t buy less than one share of a company in the stock market: if Microsoft costs $1000 a share and you’ve only got $500, then you’re out of luck</li>
<li>the market is open 24/7</li>
</ol>
<p>The leading Security token exchange is INX, and if you want to get in on the ground floor with IPOs (“Initial Public Offering”, where you get the tokens before they go on the market), then <a href="https://www.tokensoft.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tokensoft</a> is the leader.</p>
<p>Like stocks and shares, <strong>security tokens would generally be held for a length of time as a medium-term investment</strong>.</p>
<p>The Security token market is currently slower and less volatile than Cryptocurrency, and it doesn’t have too many automated traders. This means prices move much slower. The smaller size of the market means that currently, it’s also more difficult to sell the tokens.</p>
<h2>Which strategy is right for me?</h2>
<p>Only you would know that! And of course, there will be a disclaimer that none of what we’ve typed can be construed as investment advice.</p>
<p>If you have decided to <strong>invest in Cryptocurrency</strong>, the main decision is this: how much risk do you want to take on the value of your asset? If you’re happy with risk, <a href="https://aqru.io/crypto-interest/">invest in Crypto</a>. If you’re happy with 7% APY, invest in stablecoins.</p>
<p>Or, you could diversify and adopt an “all of the above” strategy where you buy some Crypto and some stablecoins and park them for interest with us and you might even diversify further and enter the newer world of security tokens.</p>
<p>It’s entirely up to you, of course. But good luck! If you’re not sure where to get started, sign up today and we’ll give you 10 USDC to try for yourself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone’s doing Crypto these days, so it pays to know how to protect your hard-earned resources from CryptoBurglars. Should you be your own bank? Can you trust your local exchange? Is there another option to prevent your <a href="https://aqru.io/insights/what-is-bitcoin/">bitcoin</a> sailing into the sunset? Sit back, grab a cup of NF-Tea, and we shall explain all about Crypto wallets.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin – 100% electronic</h2>
<p>Don’t expect to be sauntering down to the pub with a bitcoin in your pocket any time soon.</p>
<p>Crypto “tokens” aren’t a physical thing: like most money these days, they exist as data. But the data isn’t on bank computers, it’s stored in a “blockchain”. This is a fancy way of saying “big shared database stored on many computers that you only add to, not edit.”.</p>
<p>If you pay someone for something using Crypto tokens, the blockchain records what you did, and that record stays permanently.</p>
<p>Did you know? Bitcoin’s blockchain contains transactions dating back to 2008, and even contains a newspaper headline about the financial crisis that birthed Crypto.</p>
<p>So, if you can’t have Crypto in your pocket, how can you even own it? How can you prove it’s yours? And how can you use it?</p>
<p>Let’s imagine for a minute that the land registry didn’t exist. How would you prove you owned your house? Well, if you were the only one with the key, and your stuff was there, that would probably be enough proof for the world. Of course, people would know your street address – your public address &#8211; and would send stuff to you, and that’s how you’re known to the world.</p>
<h2>Banking on you</h2>
<p>Consider regular bank accounts. People and companies need to know your account details for sending money and even taking money. But they can’t access your account themselves.</p>
<p>This is because the bank needs private information from you before they allow access. It used to be security questions, but now it’s more SMS and even authenticator apps.</p>
<p>Why is a mobile phone important? Because there’s only one of it, and if you have it in your possession, it means you’re you. Say, you are you, aren’t you?!</p>
<h2>Where’s Wallet?</h2>
<p>In Crypto-land, it’s the same principle. Each blockchain has lots of “addresses”, and each address is a container that can hold Crypto. Each address is like a bank account, but a lot more powerful (and you can have loads of them yourself).</p>
<p>It’s perfectly OK for one of these addresses to be public. Knowing the address is not enough for someone else to rob you. Each address also has a hidden private key. The private keys are generated so that they’re impossible to realistically guess, even with the most powerful computers so far.</p>
<p>So, the <strong>main job of a Crypto wallet</strong> is to generate addresses for you and store the private keys securely.</p>
<p>Secondary jobs include management of the addresses, allowing trading and monitoring of prices.</p>
<h3>Making addresses friendly</h3>
<p>A secondary job of a wallet is to <strong>help you manage addresses</strong> by giving them friendly names: the public addresses tend to be collections of numbers and letters because the system was designed by techies. It’s a lot less easy to accidentally send Crypto to a Mr D. Racula if addresses are clearly labelled as “Auntie Ruth” or “Mr E. Musk”.</p>
<h2>Tokens as far as the eye can see</h2>
<p>A <strong>Crypto wallet also exists to allow you to hold and manage multiple Crypto</strong> tokens.</p>
<p>In the Crypto ecosystem, there’s not just Bitcoin (the king of Crypto). There’s <a href="https://aqru.io/earn-interest-ethereum/">Ethereum</a> (Bitcoin’s nerdy brother), Bitcoin Cash (the spin-off series), Polkadot (pretender to the crown), and thousands of other options depending on how risky you’re feeling or whether you want to “collect ‘em all”.</p>
<p>Sometimes tokens live on other blockchains. A ton of them live on the Ethereum one for example.</p>
<p>The job of a good wallet is that you don’t have to worry about blockchains!</p>
<h2>Exchange your exchange?</h2>
<p>“But I bought some bitcoin from an exchange: isn’t that in a wallet?”</p>
<p>If your coins are at an exchange such as Binance or <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a> then no: your actual bitcoin is in an exchange wallet which they own. In general, it’s fine to let your Crypto out to play with reputable companies for trading or earning.</p>
<p>“Do I even need an exchange?”</p>
<p>Maybe not. Some <strong>Crypto wallets allow you to buy and sell tokens</strong>, but keep your keys on the phone itself, or in your browser.</p>
<p>Sounds risky? Worried about computer and phone crashes? Understandable!</p>
<p>However, don’t worry. All reputable wallets use what’s called a “recovery phrase”. That’s a collection of words that looks like this:</p>
<p>necklace tilt tasked ionic unveil yard inundate tequila jukebox hubcaps arrow invoke cousin frying empty frying hatchet nagged demonstrate industrial urban energy licks lied cousin</p>
<p>It’s very important that when a wallet gives you one of those phrases, you write it down, and keep it secret! The recovery phrase is specific to the wallet you’re using so make sure you note that information too. It allows you to recover your private keys and access to your stash.</p>
<p>You may never need it, but by golly it’s good to know you’re covered.</p>
<h2>Hot or Cold Wallets: you choose!</h2>
<p>Who has custody of your Crypto and whether the private keys are online are the two biggest factors in choosing what wallet (or type of wallet) to use. Remember, your Crypto is always online, but the keys to access it can be offline (“Cold”) or online (“Hot”).</p>
<p>Hot wallets can be non-custodial (you have your keys) or custodial (if someone else does). Most people use hot wallets (because it’s convenient) that are also non-custodial (so you own and administer the Crypto). However, some financial activities (such as <a href="https://aqru.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interest earning, with companies such as AQRU</a>) don’t necessarily require you to “stake” your coins (another word for “depositing” them).</p>
<h2>Cold Wallets</h2>
<p>Your Crypto stash boils down to essentially a list of private keys, one for each address. If you have those, you can access your funds from any wallet. So, is a piece of paper with these keys written on it a wallet? Well, yes it is. It’s a cold wallet. Just keep it safe!</p>
<p>Perhaps you’d rather not trust your keys to something the dog might eat (once it&#8217;s finished on the kids’ homework). For instance, there are also USB-based hardware wallets from companies such as Trezor or Ledger. At heart, these are an electronic way of keeping your keys safe. Unlike paper, these wallets also come with a recovery phrase (if you lose the USB), and other security such as a PIN (to keep the kids out of your retirement fund if they find it lying around).</p>
<p>Some browser-based wallet apps such as <a href="https://metamask.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metamask</a> allow you to connect a hardware wallet instead of creating its own soft addresses on your hard disk.</p>
<p>“WHY NOT DO IT ALL?”</p>
<p>There’s <strong>nothing to stop you having multiple wallets accessing the same addresses</strong> or getting your private key list from the wallet and writing it down. The only limit is your imagination!</p>
<h2>Everyone’s a Wallet</h2>
<p>So, to recap: <strong>Crypto wallets create and manage addresses on a blockchain to allow you to send and receive funds</strong>, and sometimes allow you to trade and swap tokens. We bet you never thought you’d understand that sentence when you started reading!</p>
<p>You’re excited to get started. We can tell. But is there anything else you should know?</p>
<h2>Traceability</h2>
<p>Surprisingly, it’s a lot easier to trace criminal activity in a blockchain than in the regular financial system, with its portable bits of untraceable paper and offshore funds.</p>
<p>On most blockchains, transactions can be traced from the outside. This isn’t true for the global financial system, which is full of nooks and crannies for people to hide cash. So don’t worry about that.</p>
<h2>Safety in Numbers</h2>
<p>In the Crypto world, big numbers of users is a good thing. A large user-base means support, and there’s also likely to be more concern about keeping to the regulations because they have more to lose. Stick with the big Cryptos, the leading wallets and the leading exchanges and you’ll be fine.</p>
<p>Support levels can vary greatly from company to company, so always take public complaints about slow service seriously.</p>
<h2>Recommendations – getting started with Crypto wallets</h2>
<p>Here at AQRU, we use leading wallet infrastructure provider Fireblocks to ensure the security of assets that are <a href="https://aqru.io/crypto-interest/">invested with us to earn interest</a>. Used by over 800 institutions globally, Fireblocks has <strong>secured the transfer of over $2 trillion worth of digital assets</strong> to date. The wallet utilises Multi-Sig technology and next-gen protocols to provide bank-level security, so our customers can rest assured that their funds are protected.</p>
<p>Other leaders in mobile wallets are Crypto.com (“Crypto.com DeFi Wallet”), Coinbase and Trust Wallet. Crypto.com and Coinbase offer easy access to their exchanges within the app (Coinbase is more expensive than Crypto.com), and Crypto.com offers debit cards along with other features.</p>
<p>All three can be downloaded from app stores everywhere, though regulation varies wildly between countries, so they may not be available in your area.</p>
<p>One other leader for browser-based wallets (which also has a mobile app) is Metamask, a browser add-in for Chrome, Firefox and more. It creates addresses for you if you want it to, can interface with hardware wallets, and some websites can connect directly to it (with your permission).</p>
<p>NFT site Opensea.io and new Digital Securities exchange INX Securities both spring to mind here.</p>
<p>In the field of hardware wallets, Ledger and Trezor are the big names, and you can’t really go wrong with devices from either, but it might be overkill for most.</p>
<p>Paper wallets: We recommend A4, cream, with a nice texture.</p>
